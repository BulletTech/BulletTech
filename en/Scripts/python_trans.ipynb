      "I have been using MAC for 6 years. Except for Mac Pro, the remaining series of models have been the main workplace, so it can be regarded as a slightly experienced user.The machine on hand now is M1 Mac Mini (8G memory + 256G SSD), which was published on November 11, 2020, and purchased on December 18, 2020.As your own birthday gift, this machine is of extraordinary significance because it is equipped with the first desktop chip M1 developed by Apple.After the autumn officially released MAC with M1, MAC's sales have emerged in the weak personal computer market, and the experience of using is well received.So I also bought the M1 Mac with a mentality of trying it. After half a year, I would like to take a serious talk about how this machine is.\n",

      "Due to the different backgrounds of the reader, it is explained in advance that I am a practitioner of data science and is different from you in the use of Mac.During the work, programming, using common office software, and browsing web are the main use of MAC.In life, I often use Mac for simple graphic design, video editing and photo editing.So the next experience will be shared from these perspectives.\n",

      "\n",
      "First of all, compatibility is because the M1 chip architecture is converted from the X86 architecture to the ARM architecture. Many friends will worry about whether the software on Intel Mac is unavailable before, making it unusable in the new computer.In order to solve the problem of software compatibility, Apple has proposed two solutions:\n",

      ", Xcode 12 began to support the creation of a general app. The code for developing the APP only needs to write one copy, that is, the MAC native operation of the MAC native operation of the ARM architecture and the X86 architecture at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "These two schemes solve the problems of the X86 software compatibility and insufficient number of native APPs. After half a year experience, the conclusion is that the common app can run, and the use experience is almost the same as Intel Mac. It is worth noting that M1 is M1. M1 is M1.MAC can also run many iOS apps natively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in addition to commonly used software, the adaptation of the programming environment for data science practitioners is actually very important.As of June 3, 2021, the commonly used code editor has basically undergone native adaptation or a version that can be installed by Rosetta 2. The software itself is no problem.First, it is difficult to say. In general, the installation and configuration process is indeed not as smooth as Intel Mac, and the situation is more diverse and complicated. Therefore, please search for the specific tutorials.The solution I currently adopted is to use a third -party platform, such as\n",

       "'# Python Tuple Tips and Tricks\\n\\n!!! info\\n    Author: [Vincent](https://github.com/Realvincentyuan), published on August 7, 2021, Read time: about 6 minutes, WeChat Official Account article link: [:fontawesome-solid-link:](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/GmZ1Du4qJRai7D7oXKh75w)\\n\\n## 1 Introduction\\n\\nPython, as a popular programming language in the fields of data science and artificial intelligence, has received a lot of attention. Many people are learning it. However, in the pursuit of excellence, we must not neglect the basics, such as the best practices for common data structures, syntax rules, and programming thinking. If we are familiar with these basics, we can work more effectively on top of them. \\n\\nLet\\'s start by reviewing and summarizing the common operations in Python data structures: Common data structures in Python can be collectively referred to as containers. Sequences (such as lists and tuples), mappings (such as dictionaries), and sets are the three main types of containers. Flat sequences such as str, bytes, bytearray, memoryview, and array.array are not within the scope of this article.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s start with tuples.\\n\\n## 2 Tuples are more than just immutable lists\\n\\n### 2.1 Record role of tuples\\n\\nOne of the significant features of tuples compared to lists is that they cannot be modified, but another role of tuples is that they are used for [record without field names](https://book.douban.com/subject/27028517/). Since the latter is often overlooked, let\\'s take a look at the role of tuples as records first.\\n\\nBy placing elements in parentheses, you can define a tuple. Each element in the tuple stores data for one field in the record, plus the position of that field. It is this positional information that gives meaning to the data. In the following example, the tuple is used as a record:\\n\\n```Python\\n# The latitude and longitude of Los Angeles International Airport in tuple format\\nlax_coordinates = (33.9425, -118.408056)\\n\\n# Tokyo City\\'s information: name, year, population (in millions), population change (in percentage), and area (in square km) in tuple format\\ncity, year, pop, chg, area = (\\'Tokyo\\', 2003, 32450, 0.66, 8014)\\n\\n# A list of tuples, the form of the tuple is (country_code, passport_number).\\ntraveler_ids = [(\\'USA\\', \\'31195855\\'), (\\'BRA\\', \\'CE342567\\'),(\\'ESP\\', \\'XDA205856\\')]\\n\\n# In the process of iteration, the passport variable is bound to each tuple. The % format operator can be matched to the corresponding tuple element.\\nfor passport in sorted(traveler_ids):\\n  print(\\'%s/%s\\' % passport)\\n```\\n\\nThe output is:\\n```\\nBRA/CE342567\\nESP/XDA205856\\nUSA/31195855\\n```\\n\\n### 2.2 Tuple unpacking\\n\\nThe operation in the above for loop extracts elements from the tuple, which is also called unpacking. Parallel assignment is a good use of tuple unpacking, as shown in the following example:\\n\\n```Python\\n# The latitude and longitude of Los Angeles International Airport in tuple format\\nlax_coordinates = (33.9425, -118.408056)\\n# Unpack the tuple and assign each element in the tuple to the corresponding variable\\nlatitude, longitude = lax_coordinates\\n```\\n\\nAnother classic and elegant application is to swap the values of variables:\\n\\n```Python\\na, b = b, a\\n```\\n\\n### 2.3 Tuple as a function parameter\\n\\nUse the `*` operator to unpack an iterable object as a function parameter. For example, the built-in Python function `divmod` takes two numeric parameters and returns the quotient and remainder. The following example uses `*` to pass a tuple into the function.\\n\\n```Python\\nt = (20, 8)\\nquotient, remainder = divmod(*t)\\nprint(quotient, remainder)\\n```\\nThe output is:\\n```\\n2 4\\n```\\n\\n### 2.4 Tuple as a function return value\\n\\nSome functions have multiple return values. When they are assigned to a variable, the variable type is a tuple:\\n\\n```Python\\nimport numpy as np\\narr = np.random.randint(10, size=8)\\n\\ndef count_sum(arr):\\n   count = len(arr)\\n   sum = arr.sum()\\n   return count, sum\\n\\nresult = count_sum(arr)\\nprint(result)\\n```\\n\\nThe output is:\\n```\\n(8, 40)\\n```\\n\\n### 2.5 zip function\\n\\n`zip` is a built-in function in Python that can take two or more sequences and combine them into a list of tuples. In Python 3, it returns an iterator as shown below:\\n\\n```Python\\nlist_a = [1,2,3]\\nlist_b = [\\'a\\',\\'b\\',\\'c\\']\\n\\nfor i in zip(list_a, list_b):\\n    print(i)\\n```\\n\\nThe output is:\\n```\\n(1, \\'a\\')\\n(2, \\'b\\')\\n(3, \\'c\\')\\n```\\n\\n### 2.6 Other common operations\\n\\nOf course, tuples also support some common operations. For example, for tuple `a = (1, \\'y\\', 5, 5, \\'x\\')`:\\n\\n- Indexing, such as `a.index(\\'x\\')`\\n- Slicing, such as `a[1:4]`\\n- Counting, such as `a.count(5)`\\n- Sorting, such as `a.sort()`\\n- Merging tuples, such as `c = a + a`\\n\\n## 3 Summary\\n\\nThe above content not only covers the basic operations of tuples but also combines other functions, operators, and so on commonly used in practical work. When reviewing this knowledge, I mainly referenced two classic Python programming books: \"Fluent Python\" and \"Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3.\" Interested friends can read them in detail!\\n\\nI hope this article will be helpful to you, and next time we will summarize the tips for using Python lists. \\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/BulletTech2021/Pics/2021-6-14/1623639526512-1080P%20(Full%20HD)%20-%20Tail%20Pic.png\" width=\"500\" />\\n</figure>'"

    "\n",
    "我们先来回顾和总结Python数据结构里常用操作：Python中常见的数据结构可以统称为容器（container）。序列（如列表和元组）、映射（如字典）以及集合（set）是三类主要的容器。而扁平序列如str、bytes、bytearray、memoryview 和 array.array等不在这篇文章的讨论范围内。\n",
    "\n",
    "在此，我们先从元组开始说起。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 元组不仅是不可变的列表\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 元组的记录作用\n",
    "\n",
    "元组区别于列表的显著特征之一就是它不能被修改，但其另外一个作用就是[用于没有字段名的记录](https://book.douban.com/subject/27028517/)。因为后者经常被忽略，我们先来看看元组作为记录的作用。\n",
    "\n",
    "使用括号就可以定义一个元组。元组中的每个元素都存放了记录中一个字段的数据，外加这个字段的位置。正是这个位置信息给数据赋予了意义。下面的例子中，元组就被当作记录加以利用：\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# 洛杉矶国际机场的经纬度，用元组记录\n",
    "lax_coordinates = (33.9425, -118.408056)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 东京市的一些信息：市名、年份、人口（单位：百万）、人口变化 （单位：百分比）和面积（单位：平方千米），用元组记录\n",
    "city, year, pop, chg, area = ('Tokyo', 2003, 32450, 0.66, 8014)\n",

    "ESP/XDA205856\n",
    "USA/31195855\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 元组的拆包\n",
    "\n",
    "上述for循环中的操作提取了元组中的元素，也叫作拆包（unpacking）。平行赋值是对元组拆包很好的应用，示例如下：\n",

    "```Python\n",
    "# 洛杉矶国际机场的经纬度，用元组记录\n",

    "a, b = b, a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 元组作为函数参数\n",
    "\n",
    "用`*`运算符把一个可迭代对象拆开作为函数的参数，例如Python的内置函数divmod接收两个数字类型的参数，返回商和余数。以下范例将使用`*`将元组传入函数。\n",

Since the latter is often overlooked, let's take a look at the role of tuples as records first.\n",
      "\n",
      "By placing elements in parentheses, you can define a tuple. Each element in the tuple stores data for one field in the record, plus the position of that field. It is this positional information that gives meaning to the data. In the following example, the tuple is used as a record:\n",

    "# Python Tuple Tips and Tricks\\n\\n!!! info\\n    Author: [Vincent](https://github.com/Realvincentyuan), published on August 7, 2021, Read time: about 6 minutes, WeChat Official Account article link: [:fontawesome-solid-link:](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/GmZ1Du4qJRai7D7oXKh75w)\\n\\n## 1 Introduction\\n\\nPython, as a popular programming language in the fields of data science and artificial intelligence, has received a lot of attention. Many people are learning it. However, in the pursuit of excellence, we must not neglect the basics, such as the best practices for common data structures, syntax rules, and programming thinking. If we are familiar with these basics, we can work more effectively on top of them. \\n\\nLet\\'s start by reviewing and summarizing the common operations in Python data structures: Common data structures in Python can be collectively referred to as containers. Sequences (such as lists and tuples), mappings (such as dictionaries), and sets are the three main types of containers. Flat sequences such as str, bytes, bytearray, memoryview, and array.array are not within the scope of this article.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s start with tuples.\\n\\n## 2 Tuples are more than just immutable lists\\n\\n### 2.1 Record role of tuples\\n\\nOne of the significant features of tuples compared to lists is that they cannot be modified, but another role of tuples is that they are used for [record without field names](https://book.douban.com/subject/27028517/). Since the latter is often overlooked, let\\'s take a look at the role of tuples as records first.\\n\\nBy placing elements in parentheses, you can define a tuple. Each element in the tuple stores data for one field in the record, plus the position of that field. It is this positional information that gives meaning to the data. In the following example, the tuple is used as a record:\\n\\n```Python\\n# The latitude and longitude of Los Angeles International Airport in tuple format\\nlax_coordinates = (33.9425, -118.408056)\\n\\n# Tokyo City\\'s information: name, year, population (in millions), population change (in percentage), and area (in square km) in tuple format\\ncity, year, pop, chg, area = (\\'Tokyo\\', 2003, 32450, 0.66, 8014)\\n\\n# A list of tuples, the form of the tuple is (country_code, passport_number).\\ntraveler_ids = [(\\'USA\\', \\'31195855\\'), (\\'BRA\\', \\'CE342567\\'),(\\'ESP\\', \\'XDA205856\\')]\\n\\n# In the process of iteration, the passport variable is bound to each tuple. The % format operator can be matched to the corresponding tuple element.\\nfor passport in sorted(traveler_ids):\\n  print(\\'%s/%s\\' % passport)\\n```\\n\\nThe output is:\\n```\\nBRA/CE342567\\nESP/XDA205856\\nUSA/31195855\\n```\\n\\n### 2.2 Tuple unpacking\\n\\nThe operation in the above for loop extracts elements from the tuple, which is also called unpacking. Parallel assignment is a good use of tuple unpacking, as shown in the following example:\\n\\n```Python\\n# The latitude and longitude of Los Angeles International Airport in tuple format\\nlax_coordinates = (33.9425, -118.408056)\\n# Unpack the tuple and assign each element in the tuple to the corresponding variable\\nlatitude, longitude = lax_coordinates\\n```\\n\\nAnother classic and elegant application is to swap the values of variables:\\n\\n```Python\\na, b = b, a\\n```\\n\\n### 2.3 Tuple as a function parameter\\n\\nUse the `*` operator to unpack an iterable object as a function parameter. For example, the built-in Python function `divmod` takes two numeric parameters and returns the quotient and remainder. The following example uses `*` to pass a tuple into the function.\\n\\n```Python\\nt = (20, 8)\\nquotient, remainder = divmod(*t)\\nprint(quotient, remainder)\\n```\\nThe output is:\\n```\\n2 4\\n```\\n\\n### 2.4 Tuple as a function return value\\n\\nSome functions have multiple return values. When they are assigned to a variable, the variable type is a tuple:\\n\\n```Python\\nimport numpy as np\\narr = np.random.randint(10, size=8)\\n\\ndef count_sum(arr):\\n   count = len(arr)\\n   sum = arr.sum()\\n   return count, sum\\n\\nresult = count_sum(arr)\\nprint(result)\\n```\\n\\nThe output is:\\n```\\n(8, 40)\\n```\\n\\n### 2.5 zip function\\n\\n`zip` is a built-in function in Python that can take two or more sequences and combine them into a list of tuples. In Python 3, it returns an iterator as shown below:\\n\\n```Python\\nlist_a = [1,2,3]\\nlist_b = [\\'a\\',\\'b\\',\\'c\\']\\n\\nfor i in zip(list_a, list_b):\\n    print(i)\\n```\\n\\nThe output is:\\n```\\n(1, \\'a\\')\\n(2, \\'b\\')\\n(3, \\'c\\')\\n```\\n\\n### 2.6 Other common operations\\n\\nOf course, tuples also support some common operations. For example, for tuple `a = (1, \\'y\\', 5, 5, \\'x\\')`:\\n\\n- Indexing, such as `a.index(\\'x\\')`\\n- Slicing, such as `a[1:4]`\\n- Counting, such as `a.count(5)`\\n- Sorting, such as `a.sort()`\\n- Merging tuples, such as `c = a + a`\\n\\n## 3 Summary\\n\\nThe above content not only covers the basic operations of tuples but also combines other functions, operators, and so on commonly used in practical work.
