Info\\n    Author: [vincent] (https://github.com/realvincentyuan), published at 2020-03-14, reading time: about 9 minutes, WeChat public account article link: [: fontaWesome-Solid-Link:] (https://mp.weixin.qqqpom/s ?__biz=mzi4mjk3nzgxoq===2247483703&IDX=1&Sn=3a9b403a543316CF6D53454 en90f243dce77b5586 C5733EE84AAE0574CFE58F96B39AA98bb804F42C0CBE06E296F5BEC & Token = 428299100 & Lang = zh_cn#RD)\\n\\n## The work environment changes, you need key mouse and mouse equipment\\n\\nI am engaged in the work of data science, the desktop and dual screen used by the company, equipped with HP\\'s conventional keyboard mouse. The computer used at home is the 2015 13 -inch MacBook Pro, because I have always been used to using Mac\\'s keyboard and touchpads.Therefore, there are no additional keyboard mouse.I have not used a computer at home for a long time, so I have never thought of upgrading the computer and supporting equipment.\\nRecently, the company has arranged to work at home. The daily use of a computer has increased a lot than before. When writing the code with a notebook, I unconsciously lean forward. Over time, the neck will be very sore. ThereforeGet up, this can ensure that the torso is upright as possible, but after standing up the computer, I found that the use of touchpads and computers with keyboard time for a long time, because the posture of the wrist unnaturally, the wrist joints were sore.: :)\\n\\n## Device requirements\\n\\nCompared with many programmers, I am not interested in mechanical keyboards, but there are also several important needs that the equipment must be met:\\n\\n* The keyboard layout is friendly to MacOS\\n* Wireless\\n* Easy to perform multiple device switching, because it is accustomed to complete the lightweight work on the iPad\\n* Yan value online\\n\\nOf course, I did n’t spend too much time to do the keyboards that meet the requirements on the market, and it is mainly the office needs, so I basically chose it in Logitech\\'s keyboard.Logitech\\'s keyboards are indeed diverse, with the price ranging from more than 100 to 1,000, which can meet the needs of most people.Because the keyboard will not be upgraded for a long time in the future, it is planned to be in place at a time, so it is directly viewed according to the price of the price. Two players stand out:\\n\\n* Logitech Craft\\n* Logitech MX Keys\\n\\nNow the price difference between these two keyboards is between 100 and 200? At the beginning, the CRAFT is at the beginning. The price is 1700 in 2017. The price is also stable. The creative knob is also very special and it looks very fragrant.In contrast, MX Keys was released in September 2019, like removing the craft of creative knobs.If you think about it, in fact, the creative knob needs additional learning costs for the person who writes the code and it is not very useful.At the same time, due to the removal of creative knobs, the shape of MX Keys has become more concise and compact.Under the backlight function, the battery life is two days longer than CRAFT, and is compatible with iOS and iPados.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  \\n  \\n  <FIGCAPTION> MX Keys and CRAFT parameters comparison [Source: Logitech\\'s official website] </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\n## mx keys + m720\\n\\nIf it is not a special creative knob, choosing MX Keys may be a better choice for most people.Therefore, the change of idea is to buy MX Keys for 899 yuan keyboard+59 yuan for three years.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26101303/121771280-093b8180-cba1-1b-85545a8f.jpeg =\" 600 \">/>/>/>/>/>/>/>/>/>/>/>/>/>/>/>/>/>/>/>/>/>/600\">/> 600 \">\\n  <figcaption> Logitech MX Keys internal packaging box </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\nAfter the Spring Festival, the logistics speed is basically restored. After the order is placed, the packaging is not available. After all, I have not bought other keyboards. It is not easy to compare, but I personally feel that the MX Keys packaging is not bad.Because MX Keys is published with MX Master 3, it is also clearly recommended to use it with the MX Master 3 on the box to play the highest performance of this set of equipment.However, he hesitated at this moment. Because of the purchase of dozens of stents, the computer was high, which caused the two thousand key mouse and felt that it was pitted.Several 2020 mouse recommended videos, finally chose the cost -effective Logitech M720, and won at JD.com at a price of 199.The reason for selecting the M720 is as follows:\\n\\n* The mouse is full, and the grip feels good\\n* Complete function keys, good compatibility with MacOS, iOS, iPados\\n* Can switch the equipment quickly\\n* The theoretical battery life is 2 years, and the replacement can be used to replace the 5 dry battery\\n* Cost-effective-cost-effective-cost performance :)\\n\\n## actual experience\\n\\nAfter this set of key mouse equipment is arranged, the neck and wrist never hurt again.The use of Mac and iPad is indeed much more efficient than before.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26101303/121771303-21ab9c00-CBA1-1b-809-2072E31EG\" width = \"600\">/> \"\\n  <figcaption> MX Keys and M720 </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\nBoth MX Keys and M720 support Bluetooth connection. After the first connection, press the 1, 2, and 3 keys on the keyboard and the mouse to quickly switch the device, and the key mouse can use the same receiver to connect the computer.After the actual operation, it is found that the device switching is almost no delay, but the custom settings take about 1 second of the mouse sliding speed to update.In terms of custom function, after downloading Logitech Options on the official website, users can customize key functions in different applications, but custom functions can only be selected from Logitech preset lists.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26101303/121771317-430c8800-cba1-1b-802b316820.png\" width = \"600\">> 600 \">/>> 600\">> 600 \">/>> 600\">/>> 600 \">/>> 600\">/>/>>/>/>>/>/>>/>/>/>> 600 \">/> 600\">\\n  \\n  <FIGCAPTION> Logitech Options Customized button function </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\n\\nLogitech Options supports account settings cloud synchronization. Log in to the same account on different devices to synchronize all settings, eliminating the trouble of re -adjusting.Overall, software functions are enough.The level of hardware has also maintained a consistent high level:\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26101303/121771345-61728380-cba1-85ae-6a881e6a.jpeg =\" 600 \">/>\"\\n  <figcaption> MX Keys backlight </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\nThe keycap is slightly depressed in the middle. Compared with the mac\\'s own keyboard, the probability of errors is less likely. The keystroke between the two is almost the same, but the key back of the MX Keys is more neat. In general, the typing experience is better than the MAC\\'s own comes with its own comes.The keyboard should be better.The face value of this keyboard is also online, and the white backlight is also very practical in dark light environment. Individuals are also surrounded by the surrounding light around the keycap :).\\n\\nMX Keys has an object recognition function. After turning on the backlight function, the keyboard will automatically light up the backlight when perceiveing that the object is approaching. When the object is far away from the back light, it will automatically turn off.However, after turning on the backlight, the theoretical battery life fell from 50 days to 7 days. After the battery was exhausted, you can use the randomly attached USB-C to the USB-A data cable.Under the case, it does not affect the use at all.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26101303/121771352-75b68080808080808080808080808080808080808080808080808080808080808080808080808-C91eb\" width \"width\" width \"width\" width \"width\" width \"6\\n  <figcaption> MX Keys full -size keyboard </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\n\\nAs a full -size keyboard, in addition to more traditional functional and digital bonds, the multi -function keys above the number key are also very convenient to use.

Info\\n    Author: [vincent] (https://github.com/realvincentyuan), published in 2021-07-02, reading time: about 4 minutes, WeChat public account article link: [: fontaWesome-solid-link:] (https://mp.weixin.qqqpom/s ?__biz=mzi4MJK3NZGXOQ===2247484231&IDX=1&Sn=27085e9af4a0567004AA978B&CHSM=EB903DCE77925A388 9375A1E39B7C83A8555E9C4DF1A857650CE5C8096293881047F2EF07 & Token = 97683576 & Lang = zh_cn#RD)\\n\\n## 1 Introduction\\n\\nFor a team that needs to quickly publish text content on multi -platform, it is important to improve the efficiency of writing and typesetting.In order to find the most efficient way, we checked a lot of information, tested a lot of tools, and finally established a set of effective, time -saving and effort methods. This article will introduce the workflows of the Bullettech publishing article in detail to help everyone understandHow to write a beautiful article at the fastest speed and synchronize it to various platforms.\\n\\n## 2 Workflow\\n\\nIn short, there are a few steps:\\n\\n-In the theme of the idea, complete the schedule of writing tasks\\n-Colon the Markdown text that does not include any format\\n-Chen Markdown text, publish articles\\n-Track reading data and gradually adjust the optimization\\n\\n### 2.1 Concept of the theme, complete the schedule of writing tasks\\n\\nAt present, all the articles in Bullettech are original, so the team members need to meet the theme of writing every week. The team members determine the writing theme based on the channel positioning, their respective knowledge reserves and user reading feedback, and then use NOTION to perform the writing task schedule.For the skills of NOTION, please refer to the masterpiece of VOID: [Personal note application with powerful, face value online-NOTION] (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?_biz=mzi4mjk3nzgxoq==&mid=224748394&IDX=1 & SN = Fe72700771845764D33FA8E92BFF4BEF & CHKSM = EB90F15CDCE77784A67240F7202025582734689F96049835F76DB079AD70E7BBBBBBBBBB & Token = 150554771 & Lang = zh_cn#RD).\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/Gh/bullettech2021/pics/2021-7-2/1625209039771-notion%E6%8E6%9C%9 Width =\" 600 \"\" 600 \"\" 600 \"\" width = \"600\" \"\" width \"width =\" 600 \"\" \"600\" \"width\" width = \"600\" \"\" 600 \"\" \"width\" width = \"600\" \"\" 600 \"\" \"600\" \"width\" width = \"600\" \"\" 600 \"\" \"600\"./>\\n  <FIGCAPTION> Using NOON for the schedule of writing tasks </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\n### 2.1 Create Markdown text without any format\\n\\nThe formats of each platform are different, so the easiest way is to create pure text at first, and then use the \"format brush\" to brush the text into a beautiful style.Therefore, Markdown has become the best choice. Markdown can use a specific identifier symbol style. These styles can be easily converted into beautiful HTMLs for users to watch on mobile devices and computers.For example, the writing of the small title is:\\n\\n`` `\\n-Ttitle -1\\n-Ttitle -2\\n`` `\\n\\nAfter rendering, it will be converted into a very easy to watch style:\\n\\n-Ttitle -1\\n-Ttitle -2\\n\\nTherefore, when writing articles, you don\\'t have to worry about chaotic format at all.When the text is written, it is also very easy to apply the pre -set style on the Markdown file.\\n\\n### 2.3 Rendering Markdown text, publish articles\\n\\nIt is recommended to use a free MDNICE web client for rendering of articles. You only need to paste the written Markdown text to the MDNICE editor. Choose the right topic to complete the style rendering. You can build your own exclusive exclusive by adjusting the CSS styleStyle.MDNICE supports [configured github diagram bed] (https://product.mdnice.com/article/developer/github- Image-hosting/). The uploaded picture will generate a general link through the link through this link.Pictures, no need to upload repeatedly.\\n\\nAt the same time, MDNICE supports the export of WeChat and Zhihu\\'s articles style. The actual measurement finds that the export effect is great. It only needs to be adjusted slightly to achieve the release state.Use WeChat export style to be well adapted on headlines and CSDN.Multi -platform release efficiency is extremely high.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bullettech2021/pics/2021-7-2/1625210341851-mdng\" width = \"600\">/>>/>\\n  <figcaption> mdnice web editor </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\n### 2.4 Tracking reading data, gradually adjusting\\n\\nSince the WeChat public account is the main battlefield, we mainly optimize according to the reading data of the public account articles. Reading, sharing volume, after reading, follow the number of people, and the reading channel evaluation articles.Each channel is different, and I won\\'t go into details.It is recommended to use WeChat\\'s subscription number assistant. The APP can easily manage the public account: add content, reply comments, check data, etc. By using this tool, you can maintain close contact with users anytime, anywhere.\\n\\n## 3 Summary\\n\\nThe above is a brief introduction to the BulleTech workflow. Such a high -efficiency method can help us quickly convert our ideas into articles with you. I hope this article can help you.

Its free GPUs are very practical computing resources for data science researchers, but the basic free version of Colab can only use one running at the same time and must be scientifically accessible to access the products.And Amazon\\'s recently launched [Sagemaker Studio Lab] (https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/ \"Amazon Sagemaker Studio Lab\") can be described as a similar product of Google Colab. Amazon also provides free computing power. (There is a CPUOptional and GPU).== After registering an account, you can conduct experiments at any time on the web side without scientific access to the Internet!==\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bullettech2021/pics/img/1_v/sagemaker_studio_lab.jpg\"/>/>\\n  <figcaption> Amazon Sagemaker Studio Lab </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\nNote that during the process of using the CPU and GPU projects, I occasionally encounter a prompt that currently uses too many people at the same time and cannot start the project. The GPU resources are more tense than Google Colab.If you encounter such a situation, you can wait a few minutes. If you still cannot start, you can only use other environments for experiments. This situation is never encountered in Google Colab. I wonder if such conditions will be improved in the future.\\n\\nAfter entering the project, the software interface is very similar to the native Jumpyterlab. If you have similar experience, you can get started immediately.At the same time, this also means that users can run multiple code files at the same time, which is the advantage of Amazon Sagemaker Studio Lab relative to Google Colab.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bullettech2021/pics/img/1_v/jupyter.png\"/>/>\\n  <figcaption> Jupyter user interface </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\nThe file will still be stored in the system after the project is closed, so that it will continue to be used next time.In general, the experience of Amazon Sagemaker Studio Lab is basically the same as the native Jupyterlab.\\n\\n## 2 Other related learning resources\\n\\nAmazon Sagemaker Studio Lab showed some reference projects on the project homepage, such as `Dive Into Deep Learning (D2L),` Hugging Face`, etc. These are good learning resources.

Therefore, you don\\'t have to worry about finding data analysis when doing data analysis.Corresponding operation.\\n-Snowflake supports software clients to connect, and also provides interfaces for multiple programming languages such as Python Connector, Spark Connector, Node.js Driver, .NET DRIVER, etc.\\n-The convenient sharing function, users can easily share data and query statements to other users.\\n\\n## 3 Snowflake architecture\\n\\nSnowflake\\'s architecture blends [Shared-disk] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shaRd_disk_architecture \"shared-disk Architecture\") and [Shared- Nothing] (http] s: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared-nothing_architecture \"shared-nothing Architecture\" architecture to integrate the advantages of the two. Below is the sign of these two architectures:\\n\\n### 3.1 Shared-DISK architecture signal\\n\\nCommonly used in traditional databases, it has a storage layer that can be accessed by all nodes in the cluster. The computing nodes in the cluster do not have their own storage. They all obtain data by accessing the central storage layer and process it.Monitor and manage data processing through cluster control software.It is absolutely prohibited to update a piece of data at the same time.\\n\\nThis architecture is not conducive to performance play and lacks expansion.It is not suitable for such architectures that need to be updated, because Shared-DISK\\'s lock mechanism will restrain it.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"httts://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26101303/13298226-1ccAF053-4C1C-933a-F555EEBD1E29.png\">/>\\n  <figcaption> Shared-DISK architecture </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\n\\n### 3.2 Shared-Nothing architecture\\n\\nAs the name suggests, in the Shared-Nothing architecture, the cluster nodes have their own separate computing resources and storage space. Its advantage is that data can be stored in each node.When the user request is required, the route will allocate the request to the appropriate node for calculation. When there is an error in the calculation, the processing process can be taken over by other nodes to ensure that the user request can be handled and correctly processed.This architecture is very suitable for applications with a large amount of data reading, such as data warehouses.\\n\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"httts://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26101303/13298223-b99b67f5-47-b03F-AC165f76b9.png\"/>\\n  <figcaption> Shared-Nothing architecture </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\n### 3.3 Snowflake\\'s architecture\\n\\nSnowflake uses 3 different layers to build applications: `storage layers`, `calculating layer` and `cloud service layers, as follows:\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"httts://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26101303/13298227-9cb5fbcd-cb8b8b8d-448abddb2663.png\"/>\\n  <figcaption> Snowflake architecture </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\n`Storage layer` is responsible for optimizing the data, compression and existence of multiple tiny areas.The data is stored in the ranks, and managed in a way similar to Shared-DISK.The calculation node obtains the data to obtain data for query calculations. The storage layer is independent of other resources. Snowflake is deployed on the cloud. Therefore, its ultra -large distributed storage system can ensure high performance, stability, availability, capacity and scalabilityEssence\\n\\n`Calculating layer` uses virtual warehouse (virtual warehouse, relies on virtual machines) to run query statements, and the calculation layer and storage layer are designed to be separated. Between this, Snowflake realizes the intelligent cache mechanism to ensure the use of resource utilizationOptimize and reduce the unnecessary interaction between the computing layer and the storage layer.The virtual warehouse is divided into size. It can create multiple virtual warehouses to deal with different performance requirements, and the virtual warehouse is independent, so computing resources are not shared.The advantages of this design are:\\n\\n-Capons or delete the virtual warehouse at any time, and it can also be convenient to expand the computing resources of the virtual warehouse without affecting the calculation of the query statement.\\n-D virtual warehouse can be easily disabled or enabled. It is suitable for re -participation in the inquiry after long -term without inquiries or discontinuation for a period of time\\n-It can change the cluster size of the virtual warehouse very conveniently\\n\\n`Cloud service layer` is responsible for user information verification, cluster management, security and encryption, metadata management, query query sentence optimization, etc. These tasks are completed by calculating nodes.Common processing content examples include:\\n\\n- User login\\n-After the query statement is submitted, the optimizer of the cloud service layer will be passed through the cloud service layer, and then passed into the calculating layer for processing\\n-The metadata required for optimizing query and filtering data is also stored on this layer\\n\\nSnowflake\\'s three -layer architecture can be expanded independently, but Snowflake only charges the storage layer and calculating layer because the service layer is processed in the calculating node.The advantages of separate expansion are obvious. If you need more data, you can expand the storage layer separately. The strong computing performance is required. You only need to expand the calculation layer alone.For details, see Snowflake\\'s [Official Architecture Guide] (https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-keide/intro- key-html \"Snowflake architecture\").\\n\\n## 4 Summary\\n\\nAfter understanding the Snowflake architecture, I believe you can better understand why so many companies choose Snowflake, which rely on the cloud architecture to provide many companies with efficient, safe, stable, and cost -effective solutions.As a data analyst, it is better to find that Snowflake is better than many traditional data warehouses.\\n\\nRegarding the practical experience of SQL, please check the previous SQL tips: [Data Warehouse N Brother] (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s ?_biz=mzi4mjk3nzgxoq=&mid=2247484458IDX=1&Snb9d205E0D6A 4589B68687E9C95 & CHKSM= EB90F75EDCE77E480D76A140289F4217C8DE8DE8DE8DA80C89B4CF09B1B07D87EF5F256831E & Token = 969028810 & Lang = zh_cn#RD) and [SQL imperfect practice Guide] (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s ?__biz=mzi4mjk3ngxoq==&mid=2247484506&IDX=1&SN=c46E7BF8071FA6668F4CHKKKKSM=EB9072ED CE77E38C38FDFE685B1FF86590ed22AEA65B8C19F07FB7CE44B5B981929796873cc & Token = 969028810 & LANG = zh_cn#rd).I hope this sharing will help you!\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"httts://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bullettech2021/pics/2021-6-14/1623639526512-1080p%20hd)%20tail .png\" widt \"widt\" widt \"widt h = \"500 \" />\\n</Figure>',\n",

Github can automatically complete the preset operation. For example, when there is a update merged to the master/main branch, the test script check error is automatically executed.The following figure shows the component of GitHub Action:\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bullettech2021/pics/img/overView-Actor-design.png\"/>/>/>\\n  <figcaption> GitHub Action component, source: github official website </figCaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\nGitHub automatically trigger the workflow when the incident occurs.The program is then executed according to the step.\\n\\n## 3 Create ACTION\\n\\nGithub action uses [yaml] (https://yaml.org/ \\'yaml\\') to define trigger events, work, and steps. The workflow file needs to be stored in a specific location in the code warehouse: `.github/workflows`.\\n\\nWith the [Bullettech Blog\\'s continuous integrated workflow] (https://github.com/bullettech/bullettech/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml \\'Bullettech blog\\'),::\\n\\n`` `yml\\nName: ci\\nON:\\n  push:\\n    Branches:\\n      -Main\\nJobs:\\n  deploy:\\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\\n    steps:\\n      -sES: Actions/Checkout@v2\\n      -sES: Actions/Setup-Python@v2\\n        with:\\n          python-version: 3.x\\n      -run: python ./docs/scripts/Update_reaming_time.py\\n      -run: PIP Install MKDocs-Material\\n      -run: PIP Install Mkdocs-Redirects\\n      -run: PIP Install mkdocs-minify-plugin\\n      -run: PIP Install mkdocs-macros-plugin\\n      -run: PIP Install Mkdocs-Git-Revision-Date-Localized-Plugin\\n      -run: PIP Install-Upgrade MKDocs-Material\\n      -run: PIP Install-Upgrade MKDocs-Redirects\\n      -run: PIP Install-Upgrade MKDocs-minify-plugin\\n      -run: PIP Install-Upgrade MKDocs-Macros-Plugin\\n      -run: PIP Install-Upgrade MKDocs-Git-Revision-Date-Localized-Plugin\\n      -run: git pull\\n      -run: MKDOCS GH-DEPLOY-FORCE\\n`` `\\n\\nThe main points are as follows:\\n\\n-` Name` defines the name of the workflow, here is the continuing integration (CI).\\n-` On` is the event that triggers the workflow, which is defined as an update command to execute the command when pushing to the main branch.\\n-`Jobs` defines the work task.

Take Bullettech as an example. When operating WeChat public accounts, through background data, we will monitor the source of flow sources, fission, and reading attention to each article.These data can help us analyze the preferences of readers and the advantages and disadvantages of traffic channels, thereby flexibly adjusting the theme and publicity strategy of the article.For a platform that already has good data analysis infrastructure, ready -made solutions can save decision makers a lot of time, but if you build a product from scratch, how to build data analysis infrastructure and strategies?This article will take Bullettech\\'s blog as an example to introduce to you how to use Google Analytics (GA) to analyze the performance of the website.\\n\\n## 2 Google Analytics\\n\\nGA is a free tool released by Google for website and mobile application analysis. After configured GA on the website, it can capture user behavior data on the website and help you optimize the website.GA plays an important role in the following analysis:\\n\\n-The marketing: GA can clearly show the behavior and conversion rate of users on the website, which helps optimization of disadvantaged channels\\n-S search engine optimization (SEO): GA has multiple dimensions of traffic acquisition, you can clearly see what content helps get more clicks\\n-S site content: What pages users stay long, which pages are most viewed, and which page conversion rates are the highest conversion rates, and information can be seen in GA. These are key information that helps optimize content\\n\\n## 3 Google Analytics use tips\\n\\nFirst of all, you need to configure GA for your website, GOOGLE provides a detailed [tutorial] (https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en), so I won\\'t go into details.Through a few simple steps, you can deploy the Tracking ID or a Tracking Code on your website, and then GA can help collect data. These data are valuable resources for future analysis and decision -making.\\n\\nGA provides many data dimensions for users to build their own analysis reports. The sidebar of the GA is classified according to the data type:\\n\\n-Homepage: important indicators of Google preset\\n-Dist: user -defined report\\n-Sess -time: Real -time data of the site\\n-Pegetable: User portrait data\\n-C customer: flow portrait data\\n-O behavior: user behavior data at the site\\n-This: Target, e -commerce conversion data\\n\\nBasically, in each type, there is an oveal view and detailed category to display specific data details.\\n\\n### 3.1 homepage\\n\\nThe homepage contains the important indicators of Google presets, which are used to quickly preview the overall performance of the site, such as the number of user, the performance of each customer channel, the distribution of user regional, browsing time, the most click on the pages, equipment types, etc.At the same time, Google also provides a module that analyzes intelligent, which can adapt to summarizing insights.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bullettech2021/pics/2021-7-31/1627739241720- home.png\"/>\\n  <figcaption> Homepage </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"httts://cdn.jsdelivr.net/Gh/bullettech2021/pics/2021-8-1/162779080820-%B4%9E8%A7%81.png\">/>\\n  <figcaption> GA Analysis of Smart </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\n### 3.2 crowd\\n\\nThis module is mainly used to describe user portraits, such as new and old users, regional distribution, session performance, equipment type, operating system types and other information.This information is conducive to your understanding of the overall situation of site users, and there is a thinner amount of information in the side label for viewing and analyzing.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bullettech2021/pics/2021-7-31/16277425504%BA%BA%E7%BE%A4.png\"/>/>\\n  <figcaption> crowd portrait </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\n### 3.3 customers\\n\\nThis sector mainly introduces traffic sources such as natural traffic, social media drainage, direct click to enter and recommend traffic, and traffic performance of each channel. This information helps merge the transformation effect of various channels and formulate publicity customer acquisition strategies for various channels.For example, Bullettech\\'s blog is deployed on GitHub, and Github Pages\\'s search engine optimizes is unsatisfactory. Therefore, it does not dominate the natural traffic acquisition.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"httts://cdn.jsdelivr.net/Gh/bullettech2021/pics/2021-8-1/1627781320848E8%8e5%AE 5%A2.png\">/>\\n  <figcaption> customer acquisition </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\n### 3.4 User behavior\\n\\nUsers such as clicks, stay time, pages, and jump rates of various pages in a session can be viewed in this module. This information can help you analyze the user\\'s preference for content.Output content.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"httts://cdn.jsdelivr.net/Gh/bullettech2021/pics/2021-8-1/1627782229120-%A1%8ac%b8%ba.png\">/>\\n  <figcaption> User Behavior </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\n### 3.5 custom report\\n\\nThe above reports can provide insights in different dimensions. At the same time, GA also provides options to build its own data index system more flexibly. Through custom reports, you can choose a variety of basic data and form them for exclusive reports that are suitable for your own projects.EssenceAt the same time, GA provides a community [Share the data instrument panel you created] (https://analytics.google.com/analytics/gallery/), which can more conveniently refer to the excellent report template shared by others.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/Gh/bullettech2021/pics/2021-8-1/162778944404-%BBB%AAA1%A8%9B%98.png\" \"/>\\n  <fIgcaption> Custom Data Instrument Plate </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\n## Summarize\\n\\nGA is like a beacon in the night, which can help site builders better understand users and auxiliary decisions.At the same time, Google provides a [series courses] (https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/course/6).

The importance is usually based on the `training set. When the model is overfit, the importance of the feature is misleading.In this case, seemingly important features may not have satisfactory prediction capabilities for the new data encountered after the model.\\n\\nAt the same time, the importance importance based on impureness is easily affected by high quantity class properties (High Cardinality), so those numerical variables often rank forward.The Permutation Importance has no prejudice to the model\\'s features, nor is it limited to specific model categories, and the applicability is wide.Please note.If the features have a strong multiple common linearity, it is recommended to take only one important feature. The method can view [Example] (https://scikit-rearn.org/Auto_examples/Inspection/plotation_importance_multicolinear.html.html #SPHX-GLR-Auto-examples-innspect-Plot-Plot-Importance-Multicolinear-Permutance with Multicoliner or Correled Features\\').\\n\\nAt the same time, `Scikit Learn` also provides an intuitive [Example] (https://scikit-rearn.org/Auto_Examples/inspection/plot_Permutance.html#Sphx-glr- EXA MPLES-inSpection-PLOT-PERMUTATATION-Importance-Permutation Importance Vs Random Forest Feature Importance (MDI)) shows the difference between unnoticed characteristic importance and Permutation Importance.\\n\\nI hope this sharing will help you, please leave a message in the comment area!\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"httts://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bullettech2021/pics/2021-6-14/1623639526512-1080p%20hd)%20tail .png\" widt \"widt\" widt \"widt h = \"500 \" />\\n</Figure>',\n",

This is conducive to optimizing the model and yourself for yourself.The understanding of related knowledge points is also more profound.For the TensorFlow framework, Google has made a very interesting application to show the working principle of the neural network- [tensorFlow playground] (https://playground.tenSorflow.org/ \"tensorFlow Playground\").\\n\\n## 2 Product features\\n\\nThis is the homepage of TensorFlow Playground, which provides the basic function of online training neural networks (limited to multi -layer perceptuals).\\n\\n<figure>\\n<Img src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bullettech2021/pics/img/1_v/tf_playground.png\"/>/>\\n<figcaption> TensorFlow Playground homepage </figCaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\nThis product opens a variety of parameters to debug. After setting the parameters, you can train a neural network after clicking!This provides many ideas of optimization solutions for developers of deep learning, such as::\\n\\n-` `Mission type`: Classification or return.\\n-`Enter data`: If the distribution of data, the ratio of the data set, the noise and batch size in the data.\\n-` Features: Change of features.\\n-`Model architecture`: The number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in the hidden layer, the type of the neuron activation function, the regular parameter, the dimension of the output, etc.\\n-` Model prediction results `: Model decision -making boundary.\\n\\nThese influencing factors do not cover all aspects of actual work, but it provides many good entry points and a platform for experiments.This is very helpful for the principle of understanding, because you can easily verify your ideas by testing!\\n\\n## 3 Summary\\n\\nTensorFlow Playground is a very good test product for beginners. You may wish to adjust those parameters to check whether the model effect is the same as your expectations. If the result is not satisfactory, find ways to adjust those parameters to make the performance of the model better.This is actually the workflow you need to face in actual work, and TensorFlow Playground has become a very good start!I hope this sharing will help you, please leave a message in the comment area!\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src = \"httts://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bullettech2021/pics/2021-6-14/1623639526512-1080p%20hd)%20tail .png\" widt \"widt\" widt \"widt h = \"500 \" />\\n</Figure>',\n",

If they build neural networks, they will basically choose to use TensorFlow and PyTorch.When dealing with table -type data in real work, the traditional tree model performance is still very strong.However, for a long time, the deep learning framework did not build a tree model until the appears of the `tensorFlow decision forests`.\\n\\n`TensorFlow Decision Forests` provides a series of API -based models based on decision -making trees, such as classified regression trees (CART), random forests, gradients, etc., use the `TensorFlow Decision Forests`, you can use a paradigm like a neural network.Build a tree model.This article will be found!\\n\\n## 2 Get data\\n\\nAs usual, first import dependencies and download data.Use a table type dataset here to predict the type of penguin.\\n\\n`` `python\\nImport tensorFlow_Decision_Forests as tfdf\\n\\nImport OS\\nimport numpy as np\\nImport Pandas as PD\\nImport Tensorflow as tf\\nimport math\\n\\n# Download the dataset\\n! wget -q https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/palmer_penguins/penguins.csv-o /TMP/penguins.CSV\\n\\n# Load a dataset into a pandas dataframe.\\ndataset_df = pd.read_csv (\"/tmp/penguins.csv\"))\\n\\n# Display the first 3 examples.\\ndataset_df.head (3)\\n`` `\\n\\n\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Adelie | Torgersen | 39.1 | 18.7 | 181.0 | 3750.0 | Male | 2007 |\\n| Adelie | Torgersen | 39.5 | 17.4 | 186.0 | 3800.0 | Female | 2007 |\\n| Adelie | Torgersen | 40.3 | 18.0 | 195.0 | 3250.0 | Female | 2007 |\\n\\nSpecify the labeling field and convert the tag category into integer data.\\n\\n`` `python\\nlabel = \"Species\"\\n\\nClasses = dataset_df [label] .unique ().

At the same time, the default parameters can give good results in most cases.\\n-When training before training, no compile model is required, and no verification set is required during training. Verification set is only used to display performance indicators\\n\\nNote that this does not mean that the use of the `tensorflow decision forests` can save all the feature engineering, but it does save a lot of time.\\n\\n## 4 modeling\\n\\nIt is very similar to using the `TensorFlow Decision Forests` to build a tree model and use TensorFlow to build a neural network:\\n\\n`` `python\\n#\\nModel = tfdf.kers.randomForestmodel ()\\n\\n#\\nModel.fit (x = TRAIN_DS)\\n\\n# 评 评\\nMODEL.COMPILE (Metrics = [\"Accuracy\"])\\nEvaluation = Model.evaluate (test_ds, return_dict = true)\\nPrint ()\\n\\nfor name, value in event .Items ():\\n  Print (f \"{name}: {value: .4f}\")\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `python\\n1/1 [============================================================= =================================================================================================================================================================================== ====] -1S 706ms/STE -Loss -Loss: 0.0000E+00 -Accuracy:0.9608\\n\\nloss: 0.0000\\naccount: 0.9608\\n`` `\\n\\n## 5 Visual Tree Model\\n\\n`Tensorflow decision forests` provides native API visualization of trees.

At present, Tensorflow.keras has built many types of callbacks for users to useThe visualization training process, error correction, preservation model Checkpoints, and generating Tensorboard.Through this article, let\\'s learn how to use various callbacks in TensorFlow.keras, and how to customize callbacks.\\n\\n## 2 Use CallBacks\\n\\nThe steps of using callbacks are very simple. First define the callbacks, and then pass the defined callbacks in the `Model.fit`,` Model.evaluate` and `Model.predict` to the parameter of the` callbacks` parameter.\\n\\nTaking the most common `ModelCheckpoint` as an example, the use process is as follows:\\n\\n`` `python\\nElastic\\nMODEL_CHECKPOINT_CALLBACK = tf.keras.callbacks.modelcheckpoint (\\n    filepath = filepath,\\n    save_weights_only = true,\\n    Monitor = \\'Val_accuracy\\',\\n    MODE = \\'MAX\\')\\n\\nModel.fit (x, y, callbacks = model_checkpoint_callback)\\n`` `\\n\\nIn this way, during model training, the model checkpoints will be stored in the corresponding location for follow -up use.In addition to ModelCheckpoint, in TensorFlow 2.0, there are many other types of callbacks for use, let us find out.\\n\\n### 2.1 Earlystopping\\n\\nThis callback can monitor the setting indicators. During the training process, the evaluation index will no longer rise, and the training will end early to prevent the model from overfitting. The default parameters are as follows:\\n\\n`` `python\\ntf.keras.callBacks.earlystopping (Monitor = \\'Val_loss\\',\\n        min_delta = 0,\\n        patience = 0,\\n        Verbose = 0,\\n        MODE = \\'Auto\\',\\n        baseline = None,\\n        restore_best_weights = false)\\n`` `\\n\\nEach parameter:\\n\\n-MONITOR: evaluation indicator of Callbacks monitoring.\\n-MIN_DELTA: The minimum measurement of the measurement indicator.\\n-Patience: When the evaluation indicators are not improved, the number of waiting epochs that is waiting will stop training after the number is not improved.\\n-Verbose: Whether to print a log.\\n-Mode: Set the mode of monitoring indicators, such as whether the monitoring index decreases, rises, or automatically infer according to the indicator name.\\n-Baseline: The benchmark of the monitoring index. When the model training result is not as good as the standard line, the training will stop.\\n-Restore_best_weights: Whether the EPOCH recovery model with the best training effect is set to False, it will restore the model weight recovery model from the last Step model.\\n\\n### 2.2 LearningralscheDuler\\n\\nThis callback can adjust the learning rate during the model training process. Generally speaking, as the number of training times becomes more, appropriately reducing the learning rate is conducive to model convergence.

Info\\n    Author: [vincent] (https://github.com/realvincentyuan), published in 2021-08-07, reading time: about 6 minutes, WeChat public account article link: [: fontaWesome-solid-Link:] (https://mp.weixin.qq.q.com/s/gmz1Du4qjrai7d7oxkh75W)\\n\\n## 1 Introduction\\n\\nPython has received a lot of attention as the current in the field of data science and artificial intelligence, and many people are learning.However, on the way to pursue excellence, you must not ignore the foundation, such as the best practice of common data structure, grammatical specifications, and programming thinking. The most basic things are fingered, and the work on the basis of this will be ease.\\n\\nLet\\'s first review and summarize the common operation in the Python data structure: The common data structures in Python can be collectively referred to as container.Sequences (such as lists and metal groups), mapping (such as dictionary) and collection (SET) are three main containers.The flat sequences such as Str, Bytes, bytearray, MemoryView, and Array.array are not within the scope of this article.\\n\\nHere, let\\'s start with the Yuan Group.\\n\\n## 2 yuan group is not only an unchanged list\\n\\n### 2.1 Cost\\n\\nOne of the significant features of the Yuan Group\\'s distinguishing between the list is that it cannot be modified, but its other role is [Used for a record without field name] (https://book.douban.com/subject/27028517/).Because the latter is often ignored, let\\'s take a look at the role of the tuple as a record.\\n\\nA group group can be defined with brackets.Each element in the tuples stores the data of a field in the record, plus the location of this field.It is this location information that gives the data meaning.In the following example, the tuples are used as records:\\n\\n`` `Python\\n#The latitude and longitude of Los Angeles International Airport, recorded with the Yuan Group\\nLAX_COORDINATES = (33.9425, -118.408056)\\n\\n# Some information in Tokyo: city name, year, population (unit: millions), population change (unit: percentage) and area (unit: square kilometer)\\nCity, Year, POP, CHG, Area = (\\'TOKYO\\', 2003, 32450, 0.66, 8014)\\n\\n#, The form of the tuples is (country_code, passport_number).\\ntraveler_ids = [(\\'usa\\', \\'31195855\\'), (\\'Bra\\', \\'CE342567\\'), (\\'ESP\\', \\'XDA205856\\')]\\n\\n#During the iteration, the Passport variable is bound to each group.The % format operator can be matched on the corresponding meta -group element.\\nfor passport in sorted (traveler_ids):\\n  Print (\\'%s/%s\\'%passport)\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `\\nBra/CE342567\\nESP/XDA205856\\nUSA/31195855\\n`` `\\n\\n### 2.2 yuan for disassembly bags\\n\\nThe operation in the above For loop extracts the elements in the turtle group, also called unpacking.Parallel assignment is a good application for the tuple disassembly. The example is as follows:\\n\\n`` `Python\\n#The latitude and longitude of Los Angeles International Airport, recorded with the Yuan Group\\nLAX_COORDINATES = (33.9425, -118.408056)\\n# Disassembling the Bao Yuan Group, assigning the elements in the turtle group to the corresponding variable\\nLatitude, longitude = lax_coordinates\\n`` `\\n\\nAnother classic and elegant application is the value of the exchange variable:\\n\\n`` `Python\\na, b = b, a\\n`` `\\n\\n### 2.3 yuan group as a function parameter\\n\\nUse the `*` to disassemble an iterative object as a parameter of the function. For example, the built -in function of Python receives the parameters of the two digital types, and returns the quotient and the remaining numbers.The following example will use the `*` to pass the Yuan group into the function.\\n\\n`` `Python\\nt = (20, 8)\\nquotient, remainer = divmod (*t)\\nPrint (quotient, remainer)\\n`` `\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `\\ntwenty four\\n`` `\\n\\n### 2.4 yuan group as a function return value\\n\\nSome functions have multiple return values. When they are assigned to a variable, the variable type is the tuple:\\n\\n`` `Python\\nimport numpy as np\\narr = np.random.randint (10, size = 8)\\n\\nDEF COUNT_SUM (ARR):\\n   Count = Len (ARR)\\n   SUM = Arr.sum ()\\n   Return Count, Sum\\n\\nresult = Count_sum (ARR)\\nPrint (Result)\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `\\n(8, 40)\\n`` `\\n\\n### 2.5 zip function\\n\\nZIP is a built -in function of Python, which can receive two or more sequences and form a list list. A iterator will be returned in Python3, as shown below:\\n\\n`` `Python\\nlist_a = [1,2,3]\\nlist_b = [\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\']\\n\\nfor I in zip (list_a, list_b):\\n    Print (i)\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `\\n(1, \\'a\\')\\n(2, \\'B\\')\\n(3, \\'c\\')\\n`` `\\n\\n### 2.6 Other conventional operations\\n\\nOf course, the Yuan group also supports some conventional operations, such as the Yuan Group `A = (1, \\'y\\', 5, 5, \\'x\\')` `` ``:\\n\\n-In `A.INDEX (\\'X\\')` `\\n-Adl, such as `A [1: 4]`\\n-Accut, such as `A.Count (5)`\\n-Step, such as `a.sort ()` `\\n-Ame merger, such as `C = A + A`\\n\\n## 3 Summary\\n\\nThe above content not only covers the basic operations of the turtle group, but also combines other functions, operators, and operators often used in actual work.When reviewing these knowledge, I mainly refer to two classic Python programming books: \"Fastest Python\" and \"Thinking of Python like computer scientists\", interested friends can read in depth!\\n\\nI hope this article will be helpful to you. The next time I will summarize the use of the Python list.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"httts://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bullettech2021/pics/2021-6-14/1623639526512-1080p%20hd)%20tail .png\" widt \"widt\" widt \"widt h = \"500 \" />\\n</Figure>',\n",

Why do you define the function like this?What are the benefits of this, we will unveil this mysterious veil -closure.\\n\\n## 2 The main points of closing\\n\\nThe closure refers to the function that extends the scope of action. It will quote a non -global variable that is not in the definition of the function (such as the count in the above example)., Make the inner nested function that can modify the unable variables outside the domain.\\n\\nWhen calling make_counter, return a counter function object. Each time you call the counter, it will update the count. The example is as follows:\\n\\n`` `Python\\n# Run closure function\\ncounter = Make_counter ()\\nPrint (counter ()))\\nPrint (counter ()))\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `python\\n1\\n2\\n`` `\\n\\nIn this example, one thing that needs to be expanded is the storage location of the historical value of Count. Count is a local variable of the Make_Counter function. When initializationThe scope of action should no longer exist.\\n\\nIn the counter function, Countnt is a free variable, and the Counter function implements the binding of variables.You can view the name of the saved local variables and free variables in the __code__ attribute (indicating the function definition body after compiled) in Python, as shown below:\\n\\n`` `Python\\n# View free variable\\ncounter .__ code __. Co_freevars\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n`` `\\n(\\'count\\',)\\n`` `\\n\\nThe COUNT is binding in the __closure__ attribute of the returned counter function, where the elements of __clOSURE__ correspond to a name in the `Counter .__ CODE __. Co_freevars\\'.These elements are Cell objects, which can access the storage values through the cell_contents property. The example is as follows:\\n\\n`` `python\\ncounter .__ closure __ [0] .Cell_contents\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `\\n2\\n`` `\\n\\nThe closure can solve the problem of lightweight very concisely and intuitively. If the above functions are implemented in category `, it will grow:\\n\\n`` `Python\\n# Define a counter with a class, start counting from 0\\nclass counter:\\n    DEF __init __ (Self):\\n        Self.Count = 0\\n\\n    DEF __call __ (Self):\\n        Self.Count += 1\\n        Return Self.Count\\n\\ncounter = counter ()\\nPrint (counter ()))\\nPrint (counter ()))\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `Python\\n1\\n2\\n`` `\\n\\n## 3 Summary\\n\\nClosure is a function that retains the binding of free variables when defining a function. Therefore, even if the function of the function is returned, the scope does not exist, and those binding can still be used.Closures can easily achieve some simple classes. At the same time, there are many Python magics that can be achieved, such as decorators, to be decomposed next!\\n\\nI hope this sharing will help you, welcome to discuss in the comment area!\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"httts://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bullettech2021/pics/2021-6-14/1623639526512-1080p%20hd)%20tail .png\" widt \"widt\" widt \"widt h = \"500 \" />\\n</Figure>',\n",

In this article, we continue to talk about another commonly used data type-dictionary (DICT) in Python.\\n\\nThe definition dictionary can use the `diction ()` method, or use the parentheses `name2code = {\\'tony\\': 1, \\'kevin\\': 2, \\'luis\\': 3}`, if you want to increase the element, you can use the key value pair pair pair pairAssignment mode: `name2code [\\'nick\\'] = 0`.It is easy to see that different from the list, the dictionary does not use integers as a bid.Let\\'s take a look at the common methods of dictionary.\\n\\n## 2 Dictionary Common methods\\n\\n### 2.1 index\\n\\nThe dictionary appears in the form of key value pair, so you can use keys to index the values required by the key, such as:\\n\\n`` `python\\nPrint (name2code [\\'nick\\'])\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `python\\n0\\n`` `\\n\\nSimilar to the list, you can use the `In` operating character to view the key to the dictionary. It is worth noting that the implementation of the` in` operator in the list and the dictionary is different. The list uses the search algorithm, so the list changesFor a long time, the search time will also become longer, but the dictionary uses the algorithm of the hashtable, so no matter how much the key value is in the dictionary, the time is almost the same as the operating symbol.\\n\\n`` `python\\nPrint (\\'nick\\' in name2code)\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `python\\nTrue\\n`` `\\n\\nIf you want to check whether the value is in the dictionary, you can use the `values ()` method to take out the value of the dictionary, and then check it with an IN operator:\\n\\n`` `python\\nValues = name2code.values ()\\nPrint (0 in Values)\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `python\\nTrue\\n`` `\\n\\n### 2.2 Delete element\\n\\nThe method of deleting elements of the dictionary is similar to the list:\\n\\n-Cleway dictionary: `name2code.clear ()`, pay attention to `clear ()` method does not return the value\\n-An the corresponding value of the key K, and then remove the key value right: `name2code.pop (k, [default])`\\n-At the key value added and remove the key value.\\n\\n### 2.3 cycle\\n\\nYou can traverse the dictionary key to use the FOR loop. Please note that because the key can be scattered, it does not follow a specific order. The following code may have different output order on your computer (Note: Python 3.6 and laterThe version retains the order of the key value, so the result is certain):\\n\\n`` `python\\nfor I in name2code:\\n    Print (i, name2code [i])\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `python\\nTony 1\\nKevin 2\\nLuis 3\\nNick 0\\n`` `\\n\\nIf you want to traverse with your key and values at the same time, you can also use the `Items () method:\\n\\n`` `python\\nfor k, v in name2code.items ():\\n    Print (k, v)\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `python\\nTony 1\\nKevin 2\\nLuis 3\\nNick 0\\n`` `\\n\\n### 2.4 reverse search\\n\\nFor a dictionary, the operation of using the key to find the value has been introduced above. If you want to use the value to find the key, you should do the reverse search operation at this time. Note that you use a `raise statement.There is a problem with the value of the display parameter.\\n\\n`` `python\\ndefundest_lookup (d, v):\\n    for I in D:\\n        if d [i] == v:\\n            Return i\\n    Raise Valueerror (\"The value you find is not in the dictionary\")\\n\\nReversed_Lookup (name2code, 5)\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `python\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nValueerror Traceback (MOST Recent Call Last)\\n<iPython-Input-33-832e824fe6b4> in <Module>\\n----> 1 reversed_lookup (name2code, 5)\\n\\n<ipython-input-32-BE75152F6E58> in reversed_lookup (d, v)\\n      4 Return i\\n      5\\n----> 6 Raise Valueerror (\"The value you find is not in the dictionary\")\\n\\nValueerror: The value you find is not in the dictionary\\n`` `\\n\\n### 2.5 Dictionary derivation\\n\\nStarting from Python 2.7, the list derivation and generator expression have also been transplanted on the dictionary. As follows,\\n\\n`` `python\\ncode2Name = {code: name for name, code in name2code.items () if code <2}\\nPrint (code2Name)\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `python\\n{1: \\'Tony\\', 0: \\'Nick\\'}\\n`` `\\n\\n## 3 Dictionary variants\\n\\nIn addition to DICT, there are several different mapping types in the Collections module in the Python standard library:\\n\\n-CollectionS.OnRedDict: This type will keep the order of the key when adding keys, so the iterative order of the key is always consistent.However, please note that if the data is not inserted after the orderly dictionary is defined, the original key value is still disorderly, the same as the ordinary dictionary.\\n-Collections.chainmap: This type can accommodate multiple different mapping objects. When the key search operation is performed, these objects will be found one by one until they find the corresponding keys.Commonly used to manage dictionaries that represent different scope and context.\\n-COLLECTIONS.COUNTER: As the name suggests, this is a counter. When the key is updated, the counter is updated.It is often used for counting or as a multi -collection (many elements in the collection).\\n-Colllections.userdict: This class is mainly used to allow users to inherit. Inheritance this class will be more convenient than inheriting DICT, mainly because the built -in types such as DICT usually ignore the user coverage, causing unexpected trouble. DetailSee [Flowing Python \"Chapter 12-The advantages and disadvantages of inheritance] (https://book.douban.com/subject/27028517/).\\n\\n## 4 Summary\\n\\nThe above knowledge points are very commonly used in daily work. The following content also covers the summary of many Python programmers\\' years of practical experience. Let\\'s review it again:\\n\\n-Dit\\'s key must be scattered.It means that the dispersing value of the life cycle of this object is unchanged, and the object must implement the `__hash__` method, and support the use of the` __eq__` method to verify equal nature.\\n-DICT memory is huge.Because the dictionary uses the scattered list, the spread list must be sparse, resulting in low space utilization.If the amount of data is huge, it is recommended to use the meta -group or list.\\n-The key inquiry is very high.As long as the dictionary can be installed in memory, the key query speed does not slow down with the increase in data volume, but the cost of fast speed is a large space.\\n-In new keys to DICT may change the order of existing keys.The specific reasons are related to the DICT implementation method. It is recommended not to iterate and modify the DICT at the same time. It is best to divide it into two steps: first iterate to find the content that needs to be modified and record, and then change the original DICT after iteration.\\n\\nWhen reviewing these knowledge, I also have a new understanding and gain. I hope these content will also help you!',\n",

If you do n’t need to use the deleted value, Del is a good way: `Del people [0]`, then the list of the `people will become` [\\'nick\\', \\'tony\\'] `.\\n\\nc. Remove method will delete the first element to delete in the list, such as `test_list.remove (1)` operation, the list will become `test_list = [0,1, \\'a\\', \\'b\\']`, Note that the Remove method will not return any value.\\n\\n\\n### 2.4 list and string\\n\\nList and string can be converted flexibly, such as converting the string into a list:\\n\\n`` `python\\n# Convert the string into a list\\nname = \\'adam is very cool\\'\\nname_list_1 = list (name)\\nPrint (name_list_1)\\n\\n# SPLIT method can use a separatist scholarship strings\\nname_list_2 = name.split ()\\nPrint (name_list_2)\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `\\n[\\'A\\', \\'d\\', \\'a\\', \\'m\\', \\'\\', \\'I\\', \\'s\\',\\' \\',\\' v \\',\\' e \\',\\' r\\'s\\'c\\', \\'o\\', \\'o\\', \\'l\\']\\n\\n[\\'Adam\\', \\'is\\', \\'very\\', \\'cool\\']\\n`` `\\n\\nAnd sometimes it is necessary to merge the list into a string. The method is very easy to use:\\n\\n`` `Python\\n# Use the element to connect the list with a space to form a new string\\nPrint (\\'\\' .join ([\\'adam\\', \\'is\\', \\'very\\', \\'cool\\']))\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `\\n\\'Adam is very cool\\'\\n`` `\\n\\n### 2.5 list alias\\n\\nThis is a point that is easy to make errors. In the following code, the two variables are exactly the same, change one, and the other value will be changed:\\n\\n`` `Python\\n# alias is the alias of list name\\nname = [\\'adam\\', \\'is\\', \\'very\\', \\'cool\\']\\nalias = name\\nalias.pop ()\\nPrint (name)\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `Python\\n[\\'Adam\\', \\'is\\', \\'very\\']\\n`` `\\n\\nTherefore, when you want to use two independent lists, try to use a separate assignment statement or shallow replication:\\n\\n`` `Python\\nname = [\\'adam\\', \\'is\\', \\'very\\', \\'cool\\']\\n\\n# Create the same list list\\nname_2 = [\\'adam\\', \\'is\\', \\'very\\', \\'cool\\']\\n#\\nname_3 = name [:]\\n`` `\\n\\n### 2.6 list parameter\\n\\nThe tuple can be passed into the function through the `*` operator as a parameter, and the list can also be output into the function as a parameter. At this time, the function will get a quotation of the list, which means that if the list is modified in the function, the original list of the original list willIt will also be modified, the example is as follows:\\n\\n`` `Python\\n#Define a function, delete the first element of the list\\nDEF DEL_HEAD (T):\\n  Del T [0]\\n\\nname = [\\'adam\\', \\'is\\', \\'very\\', \\'cool\\']\\ndel_head (name)\\nPrint (name)\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `\\n[\\'is\\', \\'very\\', \\'cool\\']\\n`` `\\n\\nParameter T and variable name point to the same list, so when T changes, name also changes.This knowledge point is very important. When writing functions, pay attention to whether the operation will create a new list or change on the original list.\\n\\n### 2.7 mapping and list derivative\\n\\nIf you want to operate the list by a function, mapping (MAP) and list derivation are a good choice.The built -in function Map provided by Python receives two parameters -mapping functions and iteration objects, and returns an iteration object. The example is as follows:\\n\\n`` `Python\\n# Return to the square of element\\nDEF SQUARE (N):\\n    Return n*n\\n\\ntest_list = [1,2,4,5]\\nresult = map (square, test_list)\\nPrint (Result)\\nPrint (List (Result))\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `\\n<MAP Object at 0x1101B9400>\\n[1, 4, 16, 25]\\n`` `\\n\\nYou can also complete the above operation with the list derivative:\\n\\n`` `Python\\ntest_list = [1,2,4,5]\\nresult = [i*I for I in test_list]\\nPrint (Result)\\n`` `\\n\\nThe output is:\\n\\n`` `\\n[1, 4, 16, 25]\\n`` `\\n\\n## 3 Summary\\n\\nThe above knowledge basically summarizes the common operations of the list, and simply summarize the experience:\\n\\n-Dyn list method is to modify the parameters and return NONE. Be sure to choose the right method to ensure the safety of the variable.\\n-It has many ways to achieve the same operation. Sometimes the errors are not reported in the wrong method, but the result may be wrong. Make sure that the appropriate method is selected after understanding the difference.\\n-The aliases of the list of caution, in fact, more than the list, other data types will also have aliases mechanisms.\\n\\nI hope these knowledge points will be helpful to you.

This article officially began to explore the theme of anti -fraud.The primary task is to clarify the goals, obtain data and sort out data.The example provided by NEO4J is concerned about fraudulent criminals to control a large number of accounts for fraud transactions using the same physical information, so the goal is to find out the connection between these accounts and the criminal gangs.However, this example does not introduce the source of the data and the arrangement of data, and this part is actually very critical in the real work, so this article will focus on explaining the part of the data preparation.\\n\\n## 2 Get data\\n\\nNeo4j provides [multiple methods] (https://neo4j.com/developer/data-import/ \\'Import data to neo4j\\') connecting the data warehouse:\\n\\n-The manual data\\n-Worne the CSV file\\n-Prod with API to import data\\n-In import data from the relational database\\n-In use of application -driven connection to import data (supporting multiple programming languages such as .NET, Java, JavaScript, GO, Python, etc.))\\n\\nAmong them, I want to use the Python driver to import data, because usually, you can first use the Python to obtain the original data in the relationship database, and use the NEO4J interface to connect multiple platforms to complete the data transmission work.Reading and writing speed is very fast. The following is the Pyspark example code.

NextTelephone, ID number, etc.) are intertwined with many other account numbers, so you can find clues through these shared information.\\n\\n## 2 Share identity information\\n\\nIn the previous section, the relationship between the customer and the entity has been defined, such as the customer has emails, telephones, SSN, etc. If multiple customers use the same information, these contacts can ensure that they are connected.Greatly helped us deconstruct complex relationships.However, if you want to run a specific diagram algorithm, you need to deal with these relationships, because the diagram structures applied to the diagram algorithm are different. Some algorithms are suitable for the diagram of the `` `` all in the graph.There is only the same relationship.Some algorithms are suitable for the diagram of the heterogeneity, which contains multiple types of nodes and relationships.\\n\\nThe example provided by NEO4J uses [Weakly Connected Components] (https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-current/wcc/ \\'Weakly Connect COMP OneNTS \\') algorithm looking for universeThe node connected in the medium is suitable for the same composition, so a new relationship needs to be created-`Shared_identifiers` to calculate the number of physical information shared between each customer, such as the email, telephone and SSN of customers A and B.Then the attributes of shared_identifiers are 3.\\n\\n`` `SQL\\n// Create Shared_identifiers Relations\\nMatch (C1: Client)-[: Has_email |: HAS_PHONE |: HAS_SSN]-> (Info)\\n<-[: has_email |: has_phone |: has_ssn]-(C2: client)\\nWhere c1.id <> c2.id\\nWith C1, C2, Count (*) as CNT\\nMerge (C1) - [: Shared_identifiers {Count: CNT}] - (C2);\\n`` `\\n\\nIn the command, the keywords of the `with` can connect the query statement together, so that the last step variables are continued to be used in the next step.The use of the keywords of `Merge` is very wide. In general, it can make a model exist in the figure. If the mode does not exist, that is, the new model is created, which is used here to create a relationship.Please note that the amount of data in the example is small, only 300,000 nodes. If the number of nodes is huge, it is recommended to use [APOC] (https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/4.2/overView/apoc.Periodic provided by NEO4J/APOC.Periodic.iterate/ \\'Apoc.Periodic.iterate\\') method is calculated in batches.\\n\\n## 3 Create a picture\\n\\nBefore running any algorithm, you must first create a picture. You can use the `Shared_IDENTIFIERS` Relationship to build the previously created and map it to the memory.

Run the WCC to use the following commands.`Set` instructions can give the value to a new attribute. Here is a label for the cluster where the customer is located. It can be seen that the code has excluded the situation where there is only one customer in the cluster, because those people and others have no other people that no other people have no other people.Related.\\n\\n`` `SQL\\nCall GDS.WCC.Stream (\\'WCC\\')\\nYield componentid, nodeid\\nWith componentid as cluster, gds.util.asnode (nodeid) as client\\nWith cluster, colorct (client.id) as Clients -Collect combined a sequence\\nWith *, size (clients) as clustersize\\nWhere clustersize> 1\\nUnwind clients as client -unwind to expand a sequence\\nMatch (c: client)\\nWhere c.id = client\\nSet C.FirtPartyfraudgroup = Cluster;\\n`` `\\n\\nThe WCC algorithm helps identify people who need attention, and the next algorithm can continue to be calculated based on the cluster results.\\n\\n## 5 Summary\\n\\nThis part has completed the reorganization of crowd relations and identified groups with similar characteristics, which is convenient for subsequent analysis.At the same time, commonly used technical points, such as with, Merge, SET, APOC, memory estimation, creating diagrams and running graph algorithms, the next time is explained as a dangerous population for scores to effectively identify fraud criminals.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"httts://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bullettech2021/pics/2021-6-14/1623639526512-1080p%20hd)%20tail .png\" widt \"widt\" widt \"widt h = \"500 \" />\\n</Figure>',\n",

Starting from this article, it will take anti -fraud analysis as an example. As a diagram database, it will be used as the diagram database.The actual combat exercises, the real application database\\'s application in actual work!\\n\\nIn the fraud scene, bad people usually obtain the identity information of real customers through channels such as fishing, virus software, and dark networks. After obtaining this information, they can take over the verification information to take over the account or directly use this information for fraud transactions.In addition, bad people usually have a certain amount of equipment, ID cards, mailboxes, telephones and other information to cope with the verification of service providers. Therefore, the accounts that are taken over to have a certain connection with the information of these bad people.Use the Database Database to dig its potential association behind it, and this article will introduce the basic knowledge of analyzing the environment and the diagram database query.\\n\\n## 2 NEO4J Figure Database\\n\\nNEO4J is a diagram database solution provider. Its official website provides a series of tutorials and research environment for readers to learn.The actual combat uses its [Sandbox] (https://sandbox.neo4j.com/ \\'neo4j sandbox\\') for example data and computing resources, which provides researchers with free instance for experimental use.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bullettech2021/pics/img/1_v/neo4j_sandbox.png\">/>\\n  <figcaption> Neo4J Sandbox </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\nClick for free, create a database, find the `Fraud Detection` to start exploring (please remember the password)!\\n\\n## 3 cypher query language\\n\\nJust like SQL (Structudured Query Language) for querying the relationship database, the Neo4J diagram database also has its own query language -CyPher.In cypher, parentheses () are used to query nodes, such as `(P: Person)`, where `p` is a variable, and` person` is the type of this node.\\n\\nThe query relationship should use square brackets, such as `[w: works_For]`, where `w` is a variable, and` Works_For` is the type of relationship. Combining the two can query the diagram of the condition, such as querying oneActor in the movie:\\n\\n`` `SQL\\nMatch (P: Person)-[Relatedto]-(M: Movie {Title: \"Cloud Atlas\"})\\nReturn P, M, Relatedto\\n`` `\\n\\nAmong them, `match` defines the matching rules, and` Return` defines the returned content.The attribute is defined using the parentheses {}. If the person who needs to appear in the movie with Tom Hanks, you can use the following query statements:\\n\\n`` `SQL\\nMatch (tom: person {name: \\'tom haanks\\'})-[a: acted_in]-> (m: movie) <-[REL: ACTED_IN]-(P: Person)\\nReturn P, A, REL, M, TOM\\n`` `\\n\\nCypher does not need a table connection, so its query statements are as smooth as natural language.Neo4j provides a complete [CyPher Operation Manual] (https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/4.2/ \\'Cypher operation manual\\'), which is also a good reference.\\n\\n\\n## 4 Use Figure Database\\n\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src = \"httts://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bullettech2021/pics/img/1_v/fraud operating interface .png\"/>/>\\n  <figcaption> neo4j operation interface </figcaption>\\n</Figure>\\n\\n\\nAfter understanding the above basic content, you can officially enter the Database database.Click the `Fraud Detection` Database, and open it in the browser to see the operating interface.There is a database information in the sidebar, and the main interface on the right is to establish a query area.Anti -fraud can officially start!'}"
