I have been hesitating for a year to write this article. I must admit that I had a lot of hesitation when I bought my Apple Watch, because it is not a necessary electronic product. Since its release in April 2015, it has been considered by the public for a long time as a flashy but not practical product, and I, including myself, have always been skeptical about it. However, when the Apple Watch S5 was released in October 2019, the addition of an always-on screen function made it more acceptable to ordinary users, so I bought my first Apple Watch with a try -out mentality.

After more than a year of use, looking back in early 2021, I want to share my feelings from the perspective of an ordinary user about the changes brought about by this unusual watch.

Since its release, the appearance of the Apple Watch has hardly changed.
