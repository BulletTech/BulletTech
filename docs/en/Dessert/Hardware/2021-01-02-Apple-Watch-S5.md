写这篇文章纠结了一年，坦白说，本人买Apple Watch的时候就犹豫了很久，因为这不是一件必需的电子产品，从2015年4月发布，在很长一段时间里，它都被大众认为是一款华而不实的产品，包括自己在内，对它一直都怀疑态度。然而在2019年10月Apple Watch S5发布时，常亮屏幕功能的加入让更能让普通用户接受了，所以本人抱着试一试的心态购入了第一只Apple Watch。

在使用超过一年后，在2021年初回顾这只不寻常的手表带来的变化，并决定从一个普通用户的视角在此分享一些自己的感受。  

## 1 appearance


The appearance of the Apple Watch has almost ignored the appearance since its release. It used the rectangular screen at the beginning, and then improved the first full -screen design of the first rounded rectangle when the Apple Watch S4 was released on September 13, 2018.The shape of the shell is always maintained with a rounded corner rectangular design, but the Apple has distinguished the size of the watch and the shell material. Taking the latest Apple Watch S6 as an example, the size and material of the case are available:


### 1.1 C case size


* 40mm
* 44mm


### 1.2 C case material


* Aluminum metal
* Stainless steel
* titanium


If the strap is added, the choice will be more complicated, so the Apple provides provides

To simplify the purchase process, this user can easily match the size, case material and strap of the case, and then buy their own Apple Watch.

It should be pointed out that the performance and function of the same generation of Apple Watch are basically the same and are not affected by the appearance.Therefore, when choosing the above -mentioned appearance attributes, only need to be selected according to personal preference.For example, I chose a deep -space gray aluminum alloy 44mm Nike+ cooperation model (available to the Nike exclusive dial to choose from). It is not involved in daily work and sports scenarios.If a woman's wrist is small, it is recommended to choose a 40mm case.

## 2 function


Most new users will be curious, what can this watch do?This is also the answer that I have been summing up. After more than a year of use, the following most commonly used use scenarios are listed.


### 2.1 Display time


Although this is the most basic function of the watch, it was not until the Apple Watch S5 that Apple gave a satisfactory answer, because the Apple Watch S5 used the display of the Apple as ** all -weather retina display screen ** for the first time, soWatches can display time at any time.Before that, you need to lift your wrist, click on the screen or the side crown and keys to wake up the screen, which is not convenient in many cases.Therefore, all -weather display is one of the largest bonus points of all functions of Apple Watch. At present, only the new S5 and S6 have this feature.

### 2.2 Customized dial


Apple and third -party application suppliers provide many types of dials for choice. In the setting interface of each dial, users can add various functions of shortcuts as needed.Personal habits choose dials according to application scenarios. For example, you can set up dials worn in the scenario of working hours, exercise fitness, weekend leisure, and slide left and right by sliding left and right by the watch interface of the ** watch main screen.

### 2.3 View Notice & Reply Message
This is one of the original features of Apple Watch. After completing the pairing with the iPhone, Apple Watch will actively display the notification of iPhone applications. There are usually several shortcuts to respond under notification.If you receive the invitation of a conference from a colleague, you can quickly click on the watch to confirm the participation/refuse to participate. The current more mature office applications (such as Office) and instant messaging applications (such as WeChat) are adapted to quick reply. ReplyFunction.

However, due to the smaller screen, the typing experience on the Apple Watch is very bad. If you need to use the Apple Watch to enter the longer information under special cases, it is recommended to use voice reply.

### 2.4 Apple Pay & Transportation Card


Apple Watch can be used as a payment terminal for Apple Pay, so you can use watch for Apple Pay payment, or use watches to pay on buses and subway credit card machines.One traffic card cannot be used on two devices, which means that if you want to use a traffic card on iPhone and Apple Watch at the same time, you must buy two cards.


Please check if the Apple Pay supports the traffic card of your city before buying. As of January 1, 2021, the Apple Pay Express Traffic Card has supported Shanghai Transportation Card, Beijing -Tianjin -Hebei Interconnection Card, Xiamen E Card, Tianjin Interconnected City Card, Lingnan Tong Yangcheng Tong, Jiangsu Yitong · Changzhou, Jiangsu Transportation One Card Huaihai Tong, Jiangsu Yitang Suzhou, Shenzhen Tong, Yan Zhaotong, Jinling Tong Traffic Card, Changantong, Changsha Xiaoxiang Card and other 13 cities.Mobile phone traffic card.


### 2.5 Tools


Different from the application of iPhone, the original intention of many applications of Apple Watch is to meet specific needs. Their functions are relatively single. Among them, there are many practical small tools (taking the latest WatchOS 7 as an example)


* Standing reminder
* Deep breathing relaxation
* Noise detection
* Falling detection
* Find the location of the phone (by playing the sound on the phone)
* Flashlight
* Hand washing and timing (recommended for 20 seconds)
* Offline Apple Music songs
* Control the volume and song switching of the iPhone playing audio and video
* Unlock MAC


These small tools have improved the experience of the Apple product ecology on many details. Such a small computing device can change some of our habits of using electronic products.Because of this, the positioning of the Apple Watch is gradually clarifying -the supplementary & focusing on sports health of the Apple product ecology.


### 2.6 Sports Health


The reason why sports health is at the end is because I personally think that this function is not the original intention of buying Apple Watch at first, but it is one of the most important functions of Apple Watch.

In this small watch, Apple has plugged into many sensors for sports assistance:


* Blood oxygen detector (S6 exclusive)
* Electrode heart rate sensor
* The third -generation optical heart rate sensor
* Guide needle
* All -weather height meter


At the same time, many applications help you complete the exercise. You can view exercise time, energy consumption and heart rate in real time during exercise, and check the fitness records in iPhone health applications.At the same time in September 2020, Apple launched
[Fitness+ Services] (https://www.apple.com.cn/newsroom/2020/09/apple-fitness-plus-a-person-fxperience-comel-all-application-! watch/)
(Mainland China does not support it for the time being), and is committed to creating a unique personalized fitness experience, and also supports Apple Watch.These applications and services use the characteristics of the Apple Watch wearable device, so that it has evolved from an optional product to the leading equipment in a specific field.


## 3 battery life


Apple Watch
[Theoretical battery life] (https://www.apple.com.cn/watch/compare/)
In about 17 hours, I found that the actual performance was similar to the theoretical values, but in order to ensure the normal use of the next day, it is recommended to fill up the power after the end of the day.After using it for a year, I took my watch to the Apple Store and asked the genius to test the battery health. The remaining battery capacity was about 90%. The actual battery life experience did not significantly drop.


## 4 Buying suggestions


In summary, I believe you have a basic understanding of the role of Apple Watch.It is true that this is not a necessary product for everyone, but if the above functions and characteristics happen to match your needs, try it.Especially for friends who have never purchased Apple Watch and holding S4 and below, S5 and above are recommended, because its all -weather retinal display has greatly improved the experience.Such as limited budget, recommended
[Apple Watch SE](https://www.apple.com.cn/apple-watch-se/)
Because most of its functions are similar to the latest S6, it is a good entry experience option.For users of the Apple Watch S5, if there is a demand for blood oxygen detection, it can be upgraded, otherwise it is necessary to upgrade.


As a special product type, I personally recommend buying Apple Care insurance services supported by Apple Watch. It can guarantee that it will be damaged in 4 times within 2 years, and it is free to do it for free when the battery capacity is lower than 80%. Because the Apple Watch is highly integrated, soMaintenance is basically replacing new machines, so the cost -effectiveness of Apple Care is higher than other products such as iPhone.


In general, after using it for one year, Apple Watch has brought many changes to my way of using Apple products, and also brings many new experiences. Compared with the popular iPhone, iPad, Mac, and AirPods, this is this isA less familiar product, but you can't deny it. It is indeed better step by step. I believe that more and more people will accept this smart device that is closest to you.
