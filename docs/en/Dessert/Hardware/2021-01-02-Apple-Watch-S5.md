I debated writing this article for a year. Honestly, I hesitated for a long time before buying an Apple Watch because it is not an essential gadget. Since its release in April 2015, it has been widely considered a flashy but impractical product, and I was skeptical as well. However, when Apple Watch S5 was released in October 2019 with its always-on display, it became more appealing to ordinary users. So, I decided to give it a try and bought my first Apple Watch.

Now, after using it for over a year, I want to reflect on how this unusual watch has changed my daily life and share my thoughts from an everyday user's perspective.

## 1 Appearance

Since its release, the Apple Watch has undergone minimal changes in appearance. It initially featured a rectangular screen, and with the launch of Apple Watch S4 on September 13, 2018, Apple introduced a rounded rectangular full-screen design. The case shape has always remained rounded rectangular, but Apple differentiates models based on case size and material. For instance, the latest Apple Watch S6 offers the following options:

### 1.1 Case Sizes

* 40mm
* 44mm

### 1.2 Case Materials

* Aluminum
* Stainless Steel
* Titanium

When combined with different bands, the choices become even more complex. To simplify the purchasing process, Apple offers the [Apple Watch Studio](https://www.apple.com.cn/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch), where users can easily customize their watch by selecting the case size, material, and band before purchasing their unique Apple Watch.

It's important to note that all Apple Watch models within the same generation offer the same performance and features, meaning appearance is purely a personal choice. I chose the 44mm Space Gray Aluminum Nike+ edition (which offers exclusive Nike watch faces), as it suits both work and workout scenarios. If you have a smaller wrist, the 40mm case may be a better fit.

## 2 Features

New users often wonder: "What can this watch do?" After more than a year of use, I have summarized the most frequently used features.

### 2.1 Displaying Time

Although this is the most basic function of a watch, it wasn't until the Apple Watch S5 that Apple provided a satisfactory solution. The **Always-On Retina Display** introduced in S5 allows the watch to display the time at all times. Previously, you had to raise your wrist, tap the screen, or press a button to wake the display, which wasn't always convenient. The Always-On Display is one of the biggest selling points of newer Apple Watches and is available only on S5 and later models.

### 2.2 Custom Watch Faces

Apple and third-party developers offer a variety of watch faces, and users can customize each face with shortcuts to various functions. I like to switch between different watch faces depending on the scenario—for work, workouts, and weekends. You can quickly switch faces by swiping left or right on the watch screen.

### 2.3 Notifications & Quick Replies

One of Apple Watch’s core functions is displaying iPhone notifications. Once paired, it mirrors notifications from your iPhone, and many apps provide quick reply options. For instance, when receiving a meeting invitation, you can quickly confirm or decline directly from your watch. Popular apps like Office and WeChat support quick replies.

Typing on the small screen is cumbersome, so I recommend using voice replies when necessary.

### 2.4 Apple Pay & Transit Cards

Apple Watch supports Apple Pay, allowing users to make contactless payments and use transit cards. However, a transit card can only be used on one device at a time, meaning if you want to use it on both your iPhone and Apple Watch, you must purchase two separate cards.

### 2.5 Utility Features

Apple Watch includes several handy utilities:

* Stand reminders
* Breathing exercises
* Noise level detection
* Fall detection
* Find My iPhone
* Flashlight
* Handwashing timer
* Offline Apple Music playback
* Control iPhone audio playback
* Unlock Mac

### 2.6 Health & Fitness

Apple Watch integrates several health-focused features:

* Blood Oxygen Sensor (S6 exclusive)
* ECG sensor
* Optical heart sensor
* Compass
* Always-on altimeter

With fitness tracking, you can monitor exercise time, calories burned, and heart rate in real time. Apple’s [Fitness+](https://www.apple.com.cn/newsroom/2020/09/apple-fitness-plus-a-personalized-fitness-experience-comes-to-life-with-apple-watch/) service further enhances workout experiences (not yet available in China).

## 3 Battery Life

Apple Watch has an estimated battery life of about 17 hours. After a year of use, my battery health remains around 90%, with no noticeable decline in endurance.

## 4 Purchase Recommendations

If the features match your needs, it’s worth trying. If you're new to Apple Watch or using S4 or older, I recommend S5 or newer for the Always-On Display. If budget is a concern, [Apple Watch SE](https://www.apple.com.cn/apple-watch-se/) is a solid entry-level choice. If you own an S5, upgrading to S6 is only necessary if you need the blood oxygen sensor.

Overall, Apple Watch has changed how I use Apple devices and continues to improve, becoming an essential part of my daily life.
