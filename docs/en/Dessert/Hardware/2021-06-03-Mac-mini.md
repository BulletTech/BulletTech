## 1 Personal use scenario


I have been using MAC for 6 years. Except for Mac Pro, the remaining series of models have been the main workplace, so it can be regarded as a slightly experienced user.The machine on hand now is M1 Mac Mini (8G memory + 256G SSD), which was published on November 11, 2020, and purchased on December 18, 2020.As your own birthday gift, this machine is of extraordinary significance because it is equipped with the first desktop chip M1 developed by Apple.After the autumn officially released MAC with M1, MAC's sales have emerged in the weak personal computer market, and the experience of using is well received.So I also bought the M1 Mac with a mentality of trying it. After half a year, I would like to take a serious talk about how this machine is.


Due to the different backgrounds of the reader, it is explained in advance that I am a practitioner of data science and is different from you in the use of Mac.During the work, programming, using common office software, and browsing web are the main use of MAC.In life, I often use Mac for simple graphic design, video editing and photo editing.So the next experience will be shared from these perspectives.


## 2 Use experience
### 2.1 Compatibility -Overall satisfaction


First of all, compatibility is because the M1 chip architecture is converted from the X86 architecture to the ARM architecture. Many friends will worry about whether the software on Intel Mac is unavailable before, making it unusable in the new computer.In order to solve the problem of software compatibility, Apple has proposed two solutions:


-
[Rosetta 2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861)
It will be prompted to install this software when installing the APP for the first time, and then it will run in the background when needed. It is responsible for translating it into the code that the ARM architecture MAC can run when installing an app made by Intel Mac.

-
[使用Xcode开发universal apps](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/porting-your-macos-apps-to-apple-silicon)
, Xcode 12 began to support the creation of a general app. The code for developing the APP only needs to write one copy, that is, the MAC native operation of the MAC native operation of the ARM architecture and the X86 architecture at the same time.


These two schemes solve the problems of the X86 software compatibility and insufficient number of native APPs. After half a year experience, the conclusion is that the common app can run, and the use experience is almost the same as Intel Mac. It is worth noting that M1 is M1. M1 is M1.MAC can also run many iOS apps natively.


However, in addition to commonly used software, the adaptation of the programming environment for data science practitioners is actually very important.As of June 3, 2021, the commonly used code editor has basically undergone native adaptation or a version that can be installed by Rosetta 2. The software itself is no problem.First, it is difficult to say. In general, the installation and configuration process is indeed not as smooth as Intel Mac, and the situation is more diverse and complicated. Therefore, please search for the specific tutorials.The solution I currently adopted is to use a third -party platform, such as
[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index)
Wait, use it as soon as possible: smile:.It is foreseeable that for a long time, the experience of installing and running slower and updated is more discount than Intel Mac.Similarly, the software itself is basically no problem for the operation of graphic design, video editing and photo editing, but the adaptation of the plug -in still needs to be determined by the situation.


For friends who are sensitive to compatibility, a very practical website is recommended here to view the compatibility of the app:

### 2.2 Stability and scalability -conventional operation


Apple has made a lot of Macos in Macos Big S
[Important Upgrade] (https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur/features/)
: Reshape the system design language, add the control center, and optimize many Apple's own APPS.Through several updates, the stability and safety of M1 Mac are gradually increasing. In general, for ordinary users, there is no need to worry about stability. M1 Mac maintains a consistent high level!But as far as I am concerned, there is still a problem that has not been resolved so far: ** The external display intermittent black screen **, you need to re -insert the display cable to solve it, otherwise the black screen will cause the computer to restart.Many users have shared the stability problems they encountered on the Internet, such as difficulty in matching Bluetooth matching, unstable connection, SSD loss too fast, etc. I have not encountered it for the time being, and these problems vary from person to person.


As for the extensibility, in the MAC of the M1 chip, the number of Mac mini interfaces is the most and one of the most comprehensive (as shown in the figure below), and the MacBook has only 2 thunder 3 interfaces.Mac mini supports up to a 6K (60Hz) display and a 4K (60Hz) display at the same time.I use the display of the LG 27UL850. After the measurement, the use of Thunderbolt 3 and HDMI 2.0 ports can reach the output of 4K (60Hz). In addition to the occasional black screen of the display, the daily office experience is excellent.But compared to the Intel version of the Mac mini, the M1 version of the model has reduced two thunderstorm interfaces. If the interface is not enough to connect more equipment, you can buy another dock according to demand.

### 2.3 Performance -Really good guy


Conclusion: It may be stronger than 90%of the 90%of the same price, and there are enough cases in 8G.Many people have shared the excellent performance of the M1 chip in many use scenarios such as code compilation, graphic design, video editing, etc. I actually found that this is indeed the case.When buying machines, the specifications and performance of the chip are almost the same, so many people will entangle whether to upgrade to 16G memory. In this regard, it is recommended that ** Do not upgrade if it is tangled, because this can prove that 16G memory is not just needed.I only encountered one kind of resource in half a year: when 4 simulators were opened in XCODE, it was prompted to have limited resources and could not complete the request.Calmly cope, so far I have not heard the noise of the fan in the machine.

For most ordinary users, the software opens and responds to speed. When opening more APPS is one of the most intuitive evaluation indicators of performance and weakness. In these respects, M1 MAC is stronger than most of the most similar Intel Macs.For professional users, professional software, plug -ins, and other dependent adaptation takes some time. Please check the information in advance according to your own situation before deciding to buy.




### 2.4 Poor Strong Points -Must be changed next time


-Beying iOS APP adaptation: M1 MAC can natively run iOS APP is actually a very attractive thing, because the quality and amount of iOS APP can greatly improve the software ecosystemIt runs directly on the MAC in the style of iPhone or iPad, and is not optimized for desktop operating systems.So far, I have only used the iOS APP to have only Gaode Maps, WeChat reading and some simple interactive apps.
-Postly interface: M1 MacBook currently has only 2 Thunderbolt 3 interfaces. For users who need to access more external devices, the number of interfaces is relatively tense
-The compatibility of external equipment: The connection stability of Bluetooth equipment and external display needs to be further improved


In general, the Mac of the first self -developed chip completely exceeded Volkswagen's expectations.When WWDC in 2020, Apple's CEO TIM COOK said that MAC will complete the conversion from the X86 architecture to the ARM architecture within two years. In fact, as of April 2021, the sales of M1 Mac have exceeded Intel Mac [^1]Compared with the previous chip architecture conversion decision [^2], this time the process has been smooth. ** M1 provides unprecedented driving forces for the new Mac. The future is really available!


## 3 Expectation of WWDC 2021


I have some iOS development experience, so I will pay close attention to the new progress of WWDC each year. On the one hand, Apple will update all its operating systems and upgrade the development framework and tools.On the other hand, APPLE also has a precedent for the release of hardware on WWDC, so as ordinary consumers, I have the opportunity to learn about the new hardware released by Apple.Therefore, this part has collected the media's prediction of WWDC as of June 5, 2021, and shared its expectations for WWDC 2021.


### 3.1 macOS


Although Apple will update all its operating systems, only Macos will be discussed in this article.In fact, the current information about the new MacOS system is very limited, so the following content is purely speculative based on previous years updated rhythm.


-S one of the focus of the new MacOS update is to further strengthen the optimization of the Apple Silicon Macs.
-The development tools for developers to help developers adapt to Apple Silicon Macs development tools to accelerate the adaptation of the app on the original Intel Mac.
-On optimize the function of the notification center and the component.
-Che optimize the design and functions of the control center.
-On optimize the functions and experiences of apple native emails, information, photos and other apps.
-The icon design style may be fine -tuned, and rumors will use new mimic state to use iOS closer.




### 3.2 New Macs


There are rumors that Apple will release new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro on WWDC 2021. The new model will be likely to match the next-generation M series chips, MINI-LED displays, more than 2 USB-C interfaces and brand new ones.Similar to iPhone 12 Founder design, with a new magnetic charging interface, and using traditional function keys instead of TouchBar.These predictions of new chips, display screens, and more interfaces are more likely to become realistic.All in all, there are M1 MacBook Air and 13 -inch MacBook Pro to lay a good reputation. The new model is probably a higher level of product power. If there is an upgrade demand, don't hesitate!


## 4 Summary


Looking back at the past few years of experience in using Mac, I used MAC to learn a lot of knowledge and skills, and I also did a lot of meaningful and interesting things.After using the M1 Mac, you can feel that the self -developed chip is greatly promoted by the Mac experience. Like the significance of the A series chip to the iPhone, the M1 chip will provide MAC more and more driving force for Mac in the future.It can be imagined that M1 Mac is expected to become the most popular product in the personal computer market in the near future. Let us wait and see!
