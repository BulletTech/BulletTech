## Changes in Working Environment, Need for Keyboard and Mouse Devices

I work in the field of data science, and my company uses a desktop computer with dual monitors, equipped with a conventional HP keyboard and mouse.

* Wireless
* Convenient for multi-device switching, as I prefer to complete lightweight work on my iPad
* Good-looking

Logitech's keyboards are indeed diverse, with prices ranging from a little over 100 to over 1,000, which can meet the needs of most people. Because I won't upgrade my keyboard for a long time in the future, I plan to get it right the first time, so I just looked at the prices in reverse order. Two candidates stood out:

* Logitech Craft
* Logitech MX Keys

The price difference between these two keyboards in Logitech's self-operated store on JD.com is between 100 and 200. At first, I was inclined to choose the Craft, which was priced at
