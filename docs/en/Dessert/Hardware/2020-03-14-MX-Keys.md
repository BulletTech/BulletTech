## The work environment changes, you need key mouse and mouse equipment

I am engaged in the work of data science, the desktop and dual screen used by the company, equipped with HP's conventional keyboard mouse. The computer used at home is the 2015 13 -inch MacBook Pro, because I have always been used to using Mac's keyboard and touchpads.Therefore, there are no additional keyboard mouse.I have not used a computer at home for a long time, so I have never thought of upgrading the computer and supporting equipment.
Recently, the company has arranged to work at home. The daily use of a computer has increased a lot than before. When writing the code with a notebook, I unconsciously lean forward. Over time, the neck will be very sore. ThereforeGet up, this can ensure that the torso is upright as possible, but after standing up the computer, I found that the use of touchpads and computers with keyboard time for a long time, because the posture of the wrist unnaturally, the wrist joints were sore.: :)

## Device requirements

Compared with many programmers, I am not interested in mechanical keyboards, but there are also several important needs that the equipment must be met:

* The keyboard layout is friendly to MacOS
* Wireless
* Easy to perform multiple device switching, because it is accustomed to complete the lightweight work on the iPad
* Yan value online

Of course, I did nâ€™t spend too much time to do the keyboards that meet the requirements on the market, and it is mainly the office needs, so I basically chose it in Logitech's keyboard.Logitech's keyboards are indeed diverse, with the price ranging from more than 100 to 1,000, which can meet the needs of most people.Because the keyboard will not be upgraded for a long time in the future, it is planned to be in place at a time, so it is directly viewed according to the price of the price. Two players stand out:

* Logitech Craft
* Logitech MX Keys

Now the price difference between these two keyboards is between 100 and 200? At the beginning, the CRAFT is at the beginning. The price is 1700 in 2017. The price is also stable. The creative knob is also very special and it looks very fragrant.In contrast, MX Keys was released in September 2019, like removing the craft of creative knobs.If you think about it, in fact, the creative knob needs additional learning costs for the person who writes the code and it is not very useful.At the same time, due to the removal of creative knobs, the shape of MX Keys has become more concise and compact.Under the backlight function, the battery life is two days longer than CRAFT, and is compatible with iOS and iPados.

## mx keys + m720

If it is not a special creative knob, choosing MX Keys may be a better choice for most people.Therefore, the change of idea is to buy MX Keys for 899 yuan keyboard+59 yuan for three years.

After the Spring Festival, the logistics speed is basically restored. After the order is placed, the packaging is not available. After all, I have not bought other keyboards. It is not easy to compare, but I personally feel that the MX Keys packaging is not bad.Because MX Keys is published with MX Master 3, it is also clearly recommended to use it with the MX Master 3 on the box to play the highest performance of this set of equipment.However, he hesitated at this moment. Because of the purchase of dozens of stents, the computer was high, which caused the two thousand key mouse and felt that it was pitted.Several 2020 mouse recommended videos, finally chose the cost -effective Logitech M720, and won at JD.com at a price of 199.The reason for selecting the M720 is as follows:

* The mouse is full, and the grip feels good
* Complete function keys, good compatibility with MacOS, iOS, iPados
* Can switch the equipment quickly
* The theoretical battery life is 2 years, and the replacement can be used to replace the 5 dry battery
* Cost-effective-cost-effective-cost performance :)

## actual experience

After this set of key mouse equipment is arranged, the neck and wrist never hurt again.The use of Mac and iPad is indeed much more efficient than before.

Both MX Keys and M720 support Bluetooth connection. After the first connection, press the 1, 2, and 3 keys on the keyboard and the mouse to quickly switch the device, and the key mouse can use the same receiver to connect the computer.After the actual operation, it is found that the device switching is almost no delay, but the custom settings take about 1 second of the mouse sliding speed to update.In terms of custom function, after downloading Logitech Options on the official website, users can customize key functions in different applications, but custom functions can only be selected from Logitech preset lists.

Logitech Options supports account settings cloud synchronization. Log in to the same account on different devices to synchronize all settings, eliminating the trouble of re -adjusting.Overall, software functions are enough.The level of hardware has also maintained a consistent high level:

The keycap is slightly depressed in the middle. Compared with the mac's own keyboard, the probability of errors is less likely. The keystroke between the two is almost the same, but the key back of the MX Keys is more neat. In general, the typing experience is better than the MAC's own comes with its own comes.The keyboard should be better.The face value of this keyboard is also online, and the white backlight is also very practical in dark light environment. Individuals are also surrounded by the surrounding light around the keycap :).

MX Keys has an object recognition function. After turning on the backlight function, the keyboard will automatically light up the backlight when perceiveing that the object is approaching. When the object is far away from the back light, it will automatically turn off.However, after turning on the backlight, the theoretical battery life fell from 50 days to 7 days. After the battery was exhausted, you can use the randomly attached USB-C to the USB-A data cable.Under the case, it does not affect the use at all.

As a full -size keyboard, in addition to more traditional functional and digital bonds, the multi -function keys above the number key are also very convenient to use. The default settings are to call the calculator, screenshot, query definition and lock screen.Of course, these keys are also supported to change in Logitech Options.

MX Keys is very efficient to use with M720 in MacOS. The side function keys of the mouse with the drag energy to achieve the gesture of most Mac touchpads, and more physical buttons can also achieve more functions quickly, such asBrowse the web forward, backward, etc.The only thing that is not very convenient is the scaling. The default is dragged up and down from the FN+mouse, but I do not often use the zoom function, so it has little effect on the experience.

On iPados, because the external mouse and keyboard is connected, the virtual keyboard will only display the current input content without displaying the keyboard to avoid covering the screen content.

It is worth mentioning that the function keys on the keyboard and mouse such as switching APPS, adjusting the volume, and fast screenshots are also applicable. This is undoubtedly much convenient. The iPados + external mouse keyboard makes the iPad feel a new look. There is a kind of flower flowers.The illusion of making money again.Although there is no experience in transmitting the Flow function across device files that Logitech, the rest of the function and experience are satisfactory.

## in conclusion
In general, MX Keys + M720 is a combination of efficiency and cost -effectiveness, which can fully meet daily office needs. In theory, there is a good experience in Macos, iPados, iOS and Windows. The hardware quality is reliable.The software also gives users a certain personalized space, and it is still a very good choice at this time in March 2020.
