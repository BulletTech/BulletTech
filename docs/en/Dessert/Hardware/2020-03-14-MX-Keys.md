## Change in Work Environment Requires Keyboard and Mouse

I work in data science, and my company provides a desktop setup with dual monitors, along with standard HP keyboards and mice. At home, I use a 2015 13-inch MacBook Pro, and since I’m used to its built-in keyboard and trackpad, I never considered getting an external keyboard or mouse.

However, with the recent shift to working from home, I’ve been using my computer much more. While coding on a laptop, I unconsciously lean forward, leading to severe neck pain over time. To alleviate this, I purchased a stand to elevate the laptop, ensuring a more upright posture. But after raising my laptop, prolonged use of the built-in keyboard and trackpad resulted in wrist pain due to unnatural wrist positioning. Reluctantly, I started searching for a keyboard and mouse. :)

## Device Requirements

Unlike many programmers, I’m not particularly interested in mechanical keyboards, but I do have some key requirements:

* Mac-friendly keyboard layout
* Wireless
* Easy multi-device switching, as I often work on my iPad
* Aesthetically pleasing design

I didn’t spend too much time researching all available keyboards; since this was mainly for work, I primarily looked at Logitech's options. Logitech offers a vast range of keyboards, priced from around 100 to over 1000 CNY, catering to various needs. Since I don’t plan to upgrade again soon, I aimed for a long-term investment and sorted the options by price in descending order. Two models stood out:

* Logitech Craft
* Logitech MX Keys

Currently, these two keyboards are priced about 100-200 CNY apart on JD.com. Initially, I was drawn to the Craft, which launched in 2017 at 1700 CNY and has since stabilized in price. Its creative dial is quite unique and seems promising. In contrast, the MX Keys, released in September 2019, is essentially a Craft without the creative dial.

Upon reflection, the creative dial requires additional learning and is not particularly useful for coding. Removing it also makes the MX Keys more compact and streamlined. Furthermore, with the backlight on, the MX Keys offers two more days of battery life compared to the Craft and is compatible with iOS and iPadOS.

## MX Keys + M720

If the creative dial isn’t a necessity, the MX Keys is likely the better choice for most people. I changed my decision and purchased the MX Keys for 899 CNY, plus an extended three-year replacement plan for 59 CNY, totaling 958 CNY.

After Chinese New Year, delivery speeds resumed, and I received the package within two days. The packaging quality was decent. Since the MX Keys launched alongside the MX Master 3, the box explicitly recommends using them together for maximum performance.

However, I hesitated—I had just bought a laptop stand for a few dozen CNY and now was about to spend 2000 CNY on a keyboard and mouse. I looked for alternatives to the MX Master 3 and watched a few 2020 mouse recommendation videos. Eventually, I chose the highly cost-effective Logitech M720, purchasing it for 199 CNY from JD.com.

Reasons for choosing the M720:

* Ergonomic shape with a comfortable grip
* Full function keys, good compatibility with macOS, iOS, and iPadOS
* Quick device switching
* Theoretical battery life of two years with replaceable AA batteries
* Great value for money

## Hands-On Experience

After setting up this keyboard and mouse, my neck and wrist pain disappeared. The combination with my Mac and iPad significantly boosted productivity.

Both devices support Bluetooth connectivity with up to three devices. Once paired, switching devices is as simple as pressing 1, 2, or 3 on the keyboard and mouse. There’s virtually no delay in switching, though customized settings (like mouse scrolling speed) take about a second to update.

Customization is done through Logitech Options, which allows function assignments within different applications. However, customization options are limited to Logitech’s predefined list.

Logitech Options also supports cloud sync, allowing settings to be shared across devices. The software is functional, and the hardware maintains Logitech’s usual high quality.

The keyboard has slightly concave keycaps, reducing accidental touches compared to a Mac keyboard. It has a similar key travel distance but offers a snappier response. The white backlight is useful in low-light environments, and I appreciate the surrounding glow around the keys.

## Conclusion

Overall, the MX Keys + M720 is a highly efficient and cost-effective combo that fully meets daily office needs. It performs well across macOS, iPadOS, iOS, and Windows. The hardware is reliable, and the software provides decent customization options. As of March 2020, this remains a great choice.
