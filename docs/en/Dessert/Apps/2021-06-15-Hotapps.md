## Mac

### 1 Spark

[Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/zh) is my favorite mail client developed by Readdle. The free function can meet the needs of most users. Its main advantages include: clean user interface, reasonable functional layout, practical smart inbox, rich shortcuts, flexible inbox rules and search, fast multi-platform synchronization, support for various third-party plugins, and personal version is free, etc. This is a product that makes people want to use it at first sight. The only downside is that Netease blocks Spark and other third-party email clients, which is a bit troublesome when configuring, but this is not a drawback of Spark, but of Netease.

### 3 Vectornator

BulletTech uses Vectornator to complete all graphic designs. Although this software is less professional than Adobe Illustrator, its functions are sufficient for non-professional designers. As a lightweight graphic design software, it may be used as an entry choice for learning and work until skills become proficient. Then use more professional software.
