## 1 Sagemaker Studio Lab

I have always been a loyal user of Google Colab. Its free GPUs are very practical computing resources for data science researchers, but the basic free version of Colab can only use one running at the same time and must be scientifically accessible to access the products.And Amazon's recently launched [Sagemaker Studio Lab] (https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/ "Amazon Sagemaker Studio Lab") can be described as a similar product of Google Colab. Amazon also provides free computing power. (There is a CPUOptional and GPU).== After registering an account, you can conduct experiments at any time on the web side without scientific access to the Internet!==

Note that during the process of using the CPU and GPU projects, I occasionally encounter a prompt that currently uses too many people at the same time and cannot start the project. The GPU resources are more tense than Google Colab.If you encounter such a situation, you can wait a few minutes. If you still cannot start, you can only use other environments for experiments. This situation is never encountered in Google Colab. I wonder if such conditions will be improved in the future.

After entering the project, the software interface is very similar to the native Jumpyterlab. If you have similar experience, you can get started immediately.At the same time, this also means that users can run multiple code files at the same time, which is the advantage of Amazon Sagemaker Studio Lab relative to Google Colab.

The file will still be stored in the system after the project is closed, so that it will continue to be used next time.In general, the experience of Amazon Sagemaker Studio Lab is basically the same as the native Jupyterlab.

## 2 Other related learning resources

Amazon Sagemaker Studio Lab showed some reference projects on the project homepage, such as `Dive Into Deep Learning (D2L),` Hugging Face`, etc. These are good learning resources. Click on details. You can copy the project to your own files.Practice in the system.

Among them, `DIVE Into Deep Learning (D2L)` is dominated by Amazon's `Sr. Principal Scientist Li Mu, Mu Shen taught deep learning on multiple platforms:

- "Hands-Doctrine" e-book: https://zh-d2.d2l.ai/
-Bilibili @ -学 学 AI: https://space.bilibili.com/1567748478/Channel/seriesdetail? Sid = 3584977

If you are interested, you may wish to go to the corresponding platform to study and practice!I hope this sharing will help you, please leave a message in the comment area!
