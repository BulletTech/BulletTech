## 1 Introduction

In many parts of the United States, driving is necessary for transportation. While using a Chinese driver's license, you may be able to drive for a limited time in many states. However, if you plan on living in the United States for an extended period of time, it is recommended that you obtain a US driver's license as soon as possible for easy transportation in the future. This article briefly introduces the examination process and practical reference materials, using Illinois as an example. It should be noted that the experiences shared in this article are only applicable to those who already have a Chinese driver's license. For those who have no driving experience, it is recommended to learn driving skills according to local laws and regulations before participating in the examination.

## 2 Examination Process

If you hold a Chinese driver's license, you can rent a car in Illinois and go to the nearest Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for the examination. Before departure, make an appointment on the [DMV website](https://www.ilsos.gov/facilities/facilitylist.html) or go directly to a testing center that does not accept appointments. Make sure to bring the necessary documents to prove your identity and residency, which can be found in the [Illinois Secretary of State Document Requirements to obtain a Driver ºs License/State ID Card](https://www.ilsos.gov/publications/pdf_publications/dsd_x173.pdf). In summary, the required information and corresponding documents are as follows:

- **Written Signature:** Passport
- **Social Security Number:** Social security card
- **Date of Birth:** I-94 or U.S. visa
- **Residency:** Official Electronic Statement

!!! note
    There is no need to wait for a certain period of time before taking the examination in Illinois. If you have documents proving your residency in Illinois (the fourth item above) you can take the examination immediately.

The examination process includes:

- A visual test
- A written test (a total of 35 questions, 27 of which must be answered correctly to pass)
- A driving test (you can use a rental car for the examination, carrying a rental contract or vehicle insurance card)

The driving test is different from that in China. The driver first sits inside the car, and the examiner issues instructions to check the condition of the car (such as whether the lights and horn are working properly). After confirming that the vehicle is in good condition, The examiner gets into the car and gives instructions on how to operate the vehicle. The driver follows the instructions and completes the driving test. Once all parts of the examination are completed successfully, a temporary driver's license will be issued on the same day. It has the same legal effect as an official driver's license, which will be mailed to your mailing address within three weeks.
