## 1 Overview

There are many essential documents and services to apply for when living and working in the United States. This article briefly introduces the methods that Chinese citizens can use to obtain or apply for these documents and services.

## 2 Social Security Card

After arriving in the United States, it is important to apply for a Social Security Card and remember your Social Security Number (SSN), as it is required for many aspects of life and work. For Chinese citizens, you can find the closest Social Security Administration office to you on Google Maps and bring the following documents as `originals`:

!!! note
    Many Social Security Administration offices do not accept appointments. After preparing your documents, go to the office on the day of and queue up to handle your business.

- [x] Passport
- [x] I-94: US entry and exit record, which can be printed from the [US government website](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/home)
- [x] If you are an F-1 or M-1 student, bring your I-20 (Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status)
- [x] If you are a J-1 or J-2 visiting scholar, bring your DS-2019 (Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor Status)

At the same time, provide proof of your address (such as a lease agreement, utility bills, etc.).

!!! tip
    Before applying for your Social Security Card, you can fill out the application form on the [SSA official website](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw2v-gBhC1ARIsAOQdKY2dIduSgpZjZGuh0tu0R06daNR32T8LlAkqynEyMrMhQYzwoc7H5m8aAgnuEALw_wcB), and after completing it, print out the form and record the application number. You can show the application form directly to the Social Security Administration when you go, or you can fill it out on-site if you haven't done so online.

## 3 Debit Card & Credit Card

In the US, a debit card corresponds to a checking account, and a savings account has a certain interest rate. You can first open a checking account and the bank will give you a corresponding debit card. For Chinese citizens, the following original documents are required to apply for a debit card:

- [x] Passport or US driver's license
- [x] Social Security Card (Note: Not all banks require an SSN to open a checking account)
- [x] Proof of address (such as a lease agreement, utility bills, etc. Not all banks require an SSN to open a checking account)

After the application is approved, the bank will mail the card to your home address. Some banks allow you to link the card to an e-wallet (such as Apple Pay) for easier use. Refer to each bank's policy for specific details.

!!! tip
    The required documents for applying for a credit card are similar, but the bank will review your credit history and there is a chance that your application will be denied. For Chinese citizens who have just arrived in the US, you can apply for [Secured Credit Cards](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securedcard.asp), which involves locking a portion of your deposit in the credit card and using that as your credit limit. Using this type of credit card and making timely payments can help build a good credit history.
