## 1 Introduction

For a team that needs to quickly publish text content on multi -platform, it is important to improve the efficiency of writing and typesetting.In order to find the most efficient way, we checked a lot of information, tested a lot of tools, and finally established a set of effective, time -saving and effort methods. This article will introduce the workflows of the Bullettech publishing article in detail to help everyone understandHow to write a beautiful article at the fastest speed and synchronize it to various platforms.

## 2 Workflow

In short, there are a few steps:

-In the theme of the idea, complete the schedule of writing tasks
-Colon the Markdown text that does not include any format
-Chen Markdown text, publish articles
-Track reading data and gradually adjust the optimization

### 2.1 Concept of the theme, complete the schedule of writing tasks

At present, all the articles in Bullettech are original, so the team members need to meet the theme of writing every week. The team members determine the writing theme based on the channel positioning, their respective knowledge reserves and user reading feedback, and then use NOTION to perform the writing task schedule.For the skills of NOTION, please refer to the masterpiece of VOID: [Personal note application with powerful, face value online-NOTION] (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?_biz=mzi4mjk3nzgxoq==&mid=224748394&IDX=1 & SN = Fe72700771845764D33FA8E92BFF4BEF & CHKSM = EB90F15CDCE77784A67240F7202025582734689F96049835F76DB079AD70E7BBBBBBBBBB & Token = 150554771 & Lang = zh_cn#RD).

### 2.1 Create Markdown text without any format

The formats of each platform are different, so the easiest way is to create pure text at first, and then use the "format brush" to brush the text into a beautiful style.Therefore, Markdown has become the best choice. Markdown can use a specific identifier symbol style. These styles can be easily converted into beautiful HTMLs for users to watch on mobile devices and computers.For example, the writing of the small title is:

`` `
-Ttitle -1
-Ttitle -2
`` `

After rendering, it will be converted into a very easy to watch style:

-Ttitle -1
-Ttitle -2

Therefore, when writing articles, you don't have to worry about chaotic format at all.When the text is written, it is also very easy to apply the pre -set style on the Markdown file.

### 2.3 Rendering Markdown text, publish articles

It is recommended to use a free MDNICE web client for rendering of articles. You only need to paste the written Markdown text to the MDNICE editor. Choose the right topic to complete the style rendering. You can build your own exclusive exclusive by adjusting the CSS styleStyle.MDNICE supports [configured github diagram bed] (https://product.mdnice.com/article/developer/github- Image-hosting/). The uploaded picture will generate a general link through the link through this link.Pictures, no need to upload repeatedly.

At the same time, MDNICE supports the export of WeChat and Zhihu's articles style. The actual measurement finds that the export effect is great. It only needs to be adjusted slightly to achieve the release state.Use WeChat export style to be well adapted on headlines and CSDN.Multi -platform release efficiency is extremely high.

### 2.4 Tracking reading data, gradually adjusting

Since the WeChat public account is the main battlefield, we mainly optimize according to the reading data of the public account articles. Reading, sharing volume, after reading, follow the number of people, and the reading channel evaluation articles.Each channel is different, and I won't go into details.It is recommended to use WeChat's subscription number assistant. The APP can easily manage the public account: add content, reply comments, check data, etc. By using this tool, you can maintain close contact with users anytime, anywhere.
