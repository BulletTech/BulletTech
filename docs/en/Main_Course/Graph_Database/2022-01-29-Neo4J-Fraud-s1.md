## 1 Introduction

In [first recognition database] (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s ?__biz=mzi4mjk3ngxoq=&mid=2247485112&IDX=1&SN4FD472A3D58378A2F&CHKKSM=EB99EB99 0F5CCDCDCDA0285D53331834A787364D4458A3588173C9ef6953499362BD64F7C918 & Token = 1650861834 & LANG = zh_cn#RD), we introduceThe basic constituent elements of the graph, such as nodes, attributes, relationships, etc. At the same time, it also briefly describes the advantages of the diagram database compared to the traditional relationship database. Starting from this article, it will take anti -fraud analysis as an example. As a diagram database, it will be used as the diagram database.The actual combat exercises, the real application database's application in actual work!

In the fraud scene, bad people usually obtain the identity information of real customers through channels such as fishing, virus software, and dark networks. After obtaining this information, they can take over the verification information to take over the account or directly use this information for fraud transactions.In addition, bad people usually have a certain amount of equipment, ID cards, mailboxes, telephones and other information to cope with the verification of service providers. Therefore, the accounts that are taken over to have a certain connection with the information of these bad people.Use the Database Database to dig its potential association behind it, and this article will introduce the basic knowledge of analyzing the environment and the diagram database query.

## 2 NEO4J Figure Database

NEO4J is a diagram database solution provider. Its official website provides a series of tutorials and research environment for readers to learn.The actual combat uses its [Sandbox] (https://sandbox.neo4j.com/ 'neo4j sandbox') for example data and computing resources, which provides researchers with free instance for experimental use.

## 3 cypher query language

Just like SQL (Structudured Query Language) for querying the relationship database, the Neo4J diagram database also has its own query language -CyPher.In cypher, parentheses () are used to query nodes, such as `(P: Person)`, where `p` is a variable, and` person` is the type of this node.

The query relationship should use square brackets, such as `[w: works_For]`, where `w` is a variable, and` Works_For` is the type of relationship. Combining the two can query the diagram of the condition, such as querying oneActor in the movie:

`` `SQL
Match (P: Person)-[Relatedto]-(M: Movie {Title: "Cloud Atlas"})
Return P, M, Relatedto
`` `

Among them, `match` defines the matching rules, and` Return` defines the returned content.The attribute is defined using the parentheses {}. If the person who needs to appear in the movie with Tom Hanks, you can use the following query statements:

`` `SQL
Match (tom: person {name: 'tom haanks'})-[a: acted_in]-> (m: movie) <-[REL: ACTED_IN]-(P: Person)
Return P, A, REL, M, TOM
`` `

Cypher does not need a table connection, so its query statements are as smooth as natural language.Neo4j provides a complete [CyPher Operation Manual] (https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/4.2/ 'Cypher operation manual'), which is also a good reference.


## 4 Use Figure Database

After understanding the above basic content, you can officially enter the Database database.Click the `Fraud Detection` Database, and open it in the browser to see the operating interface.There is a database information in the sidebar, and the main interface on the right is to establish a query area.Anti -fraud can officially start!
