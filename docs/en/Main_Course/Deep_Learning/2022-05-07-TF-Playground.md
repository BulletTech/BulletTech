## 1 Introduction

When studying deep learning, I have a deep understanding of the benefits of visualization: If you have an intuitive understanding of information, model structure, model output and other information, it will be easier to find possible errors. This is conducive to optimizing the model and yourself for yourself.The understanding of related knowledge points is also more profound.For the TensorFlow framework, Google has made a very interesting application to show the working principle of the neural network- [tensorFlow playground] (https://playground.tenSorflow.org/ "tensorFlow Playground").

## 2 Product features

This is the homepage of TensorFlow Playground, which provides the basic function of online training neural networks (limited to multi -layer perceptuals).

This product opens a variety of parameters to debug. After setting the parameters, you can train a neural network after clicking!This provides many ideas of optimization solutions for developers of deep learning, such as::

-` `Mission type`: Classification or return.
-`Enter data`: If the distribution of data, the ratio of the data set, the noise and batch size in the data.
-` Features: Change of features.
-`Model architecture`: The number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in the hidden layer, the type of the neuron activation function, the regular parameter, the dimension of the output, etc.
-` Model prediction results `: Model decision -making boundary.

These influencing factors do not cover all aspects of actual work, but it provides many good entry points and a platform for experiments.This is very helpful for the principle of understanding, because you can easily verify your ideas by testing!

## 3 Summary

TensorFlow Playground is a very good test product for beginners. You may wish to adjust those parameters to check whether the model effect is the same as your expectations. If the result is not satisfactory, find ways to adjust those parameters to make the performance of the model better.This is actually the workflow you need to face in actual work, and TensorFlow Playground has become a very good start!I hope this sharing will help you, please leave a message in the comment area!
