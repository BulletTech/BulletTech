## 1 Introduction

Although Apple Silicon Macs have shown outstanding performance, compatibility issues still cannot be ignored for ordinary users. Installing TensorFlow on Apple Silicon is not as simple as typing `pip install tensorflow` on Intel Macs. However, numerous developers and Apple itself are working tirelessly to optimize Apple Silicon Macs. Now, installing TensorFlow on Apple Silicon has become much easier. This article will share the [recommended method](https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/ 'Getting Started with tensorflow-metal PluggableDevice') for installing TensorFlow on Apple Silicon Macs. We recommend bookmarking this article for future use!

## 2 Confirm the Machine Type

This tutorial is suitable for Apple Silicon Macs. You can confirm the machine type by clicking the Apple logo on the top navigation bar and selecting “About This Mac”. Be sure to identify the Apple Silicon Mac.

## 3 Install TensorFlow

### 3.1 Install Conda

First, download Conda: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh

The downloaded file will appear in the download folder by default (`~/Downloads/`). Open the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
chmod +x ~/Downloads/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh
sh ~/Downloads/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh
```

Follow the prompts to install, and then activate the Conda environment:

```bash
source ~/miniforge3/bin/activate
```

### 3.2 Install TensorFlow Dependencies

After activating the Conda environment, you can install the dependencies required by TensorFlow. The command is as follows:

```bash
conda install -c apple tensorflow-deps
```

When installing a new version of TensorFlow, Apple recommends doing the following first:

```bash
# Uninstall the existing tensorflow-macos and tensorflow-metal
python -m pip uninstall tensorflow-macos
python -m pip uninstall tensorflow-metal
# Upgrade tensorflow-deps
conda install -c apple tensorflow-deps --force-reinstall
```

### 3.3 Install TensorFlow

Continue to run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python -m pip install tensorflow-macos
```

## 4 Use TensorFlow

You can first install Jupyter Notebook, the command is as follows:

```bash
conda install notebook -y
```

Then, start Jupyter Notebook to test whether TensorFlow has been successfully installed, and run the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Create a new notebook and import TensorFlow for inspection:
