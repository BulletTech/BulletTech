## 1 Introduction


[M1 Mac MINI uses a half-year experience-MAC's new future] (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/m1j07zcw_gbmbqzyp9zghg) This article mentioned the excellent performance of the Apple Silicon Mac, but the compatibility problem is for ordinary users.The words still cannot be ignored. Among them, installing TensorFlow is not as simple as using a sentence on Intel Macs.But many developers and Apple themselves are working hard for the optimization of the Apple Silicon Macs. Now it is much easier to install TensorFlow.This article will share the [Recommended Method] (https://developer.apple.com/metalFlow- Plugin/'Getting Starth Tensorflow-Metal Plugga bledevice ')
It is recommended to collect it and use it in the future!


## 2 to confirm the machine type


This tutorial is suitable for Apple Silicon Macs, confirming the type of machine, and found in the Apple logo in the upper left corner of the top navigation bar.
Mac), be sure to recognize Apple Silicon.

## 3 Install tensorFlow


### 3.1 Install Conda


First download Conda: https://github.com/Conda-Forge/minIForge/Latest/download/miniforge3-macosx-ram64.SH


Download the downloaded file by default will appear in the download folder (~/doubleAds/), open the terminal (terminal) and run the following commands:

```bash
chmod +x ~/Downloads/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh
sh ~/Downloads/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh
```


Install according to the prompts, and then activate the Conda environment:


```bash
source ~/miniforge3/bin/activate
```


### 3.2 Install tensorflow dependencies


After activating the Conda environment, you can install the dependencies required for TensorFlow.


```bash
conda install -c apple tensorflow-deps
```


When installing a new version of TensorFlow, Apple recommends the following work:


```bash
# 的
python -m pip uninstall tensorflow-macos
python -m pip uninstall tensorflow-metal
# TensorFlow-Deps
conda install -c apple tensorflow-deps --force-reinstall
```


### 3.3 Install tensorFlow


Continue to run the following commands at the terminal (Terminal):


```bash
python -m pip install tensorflow-macos
```


## 4 Use tensorflow


You can first install the Jupyter Notebook, the command is as follows:


```bash
Conda Install Notebook -and
```


Then start the Jupyter Notebook test whether TensorFlow has been successfully installed and runs the command:


```bash
jupyter notebook
```


Create a new notebook and import tensorFlow for inspection:
