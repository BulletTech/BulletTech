## 1 Introduction

Introduction to [TensorFlow Playground] (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s ?__biz=mzi4mjk3ngxoq=&mid=2247485294&IDX=1&SN=Deef8a34853332AA43BFF8DE 23bf0 & chksm = EB90F41Adce7777778B4C510645F1A04ba7644F7ED53E039B09E900F04CFAE88A2D1E3 & Token = 172692856 & Lang = zh_cn#RD , I introduced itA product that recognizes neural networks (CNN) in a visual method. This content will share a similar website-`CNN Explainer`.The method shows the convolutional neural network and its related knowledge points.The address of the CNN Explaineer website is: https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-erxplainer/.

## 2 Product characteristics

The head of the CNN Explaineer website is a convolutional neural network for picture classification. The input is the three channels (red, green and blue) of the picture.If you come out, you can see the input of each convolution nucleus.

Click on the convolution layer, the animation will show convolution operation, sweep the input picture step by step by step, form an output:

Click the exclamation mark to jump to the corresponding documentation and examples. For example, for convolution operations, you can experience its working principle by adjusting the parameters of the input and convolution kernels.Document description and reference link.Product developers are really attentive!

The operating schematic diagram and formula of the RELU activation function commonly used in convolution layers can also be displayed by clicking the corresponding layer:

Similarly, the schematic diagram and formula of the MaxPooling layer also vividly displayed, and the maximum value in the input was taken out as the output:

Finally, the output layer shows the model of the model prediction to varying degrees.

## 3 Summary

CNN Explainer showed important technical principles such as convolution operation, RELU function, SoftMax function, pooling, and flat layer in a very vivid way. You can also upload your own pictures for the model to predict it. Please try it yourself!I hope this sharing will help you, please leave a message in the comment area!
