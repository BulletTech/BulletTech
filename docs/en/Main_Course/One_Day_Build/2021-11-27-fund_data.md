## 1 Introduction

As novice investors, we all have a dream of buying funds, buying stocks, navigating the stock market, and reaching the pinnacle of life.  
As non-professional investors, we often can only obtain information about financial products through apps provided by financial institutions such as Alipay, TianTian Fund, Danjuan Fund, and brokerages. Although the functions of these apps are constantly being improved, there are always times when they cannot meet our needs.
For example, we may want to obtain the net value of a fund portfolio or calculate statistical indicators, correlation, volatility, etc. for the funds we purchased.  
How to obtain data on these financial products has become the first question of our scientific investment. This article will introduce how to use Python to obtain fund market data. The main considerations for selecting funds are: it is more difficult to obtain data for funds and fund portfolios than for stocks, and the audience for investing in funds seems to be slightly larger.


## 2 Obtaining Danjuan Fund Data

I mainly purchase some fund portfolios through Danjuan Fund and TianTian Fund. Because of its aesthetics and ease of use, I am more inclined to use Danjuan Fund (not an ad). But its disadvantage is that it cannot efficiently export the net value of the portfolio. With the raw data, I can do some analysis, such as comparing multiple portfolios, calculating statistical indicators, etc.  


We can open Danjuan Fund on the mobile app or computer side, and search for the portfolios we are concerned about, such as [I Want to be Steady and Happy](https://danjuanapp.com/strategy/CSI1014?channel=1300100141) (for illustration only, not investment advice).


The following figure shows its revenue trend.

We can click on Net Value and Performance to jump to the [net value and performance page](https://danjuanapp.com/net-performance/CSI1014).

Although we have the data, we cannot easily export it. At this time, we can use the black technology Python to obtain the data we have been longing for.  
The first thing we need to do is to try to find the source of the data. We open the developer tool on the first page, click Network, and refresh the webpage.

We find CSI1014?type=2&day=all in the list of Names, and click on its Response on the right, or double-click it. We can see the net value data we want for each day.

At this time, the data format is not very friendly, but we can use Python to obtain the above data and process it into the desired format.

```python
import pandas as pd
header={"User-Agent":"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:34.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/34.0"}
import requests

url='https://danjuanapp.com/djapi/plan/v2/growth/CSI1014?type=2&day=all'
response=requests.get(url,headers=header)
f=pd.read_json(response.content)
ff=f.loc['fund_nav_growth','data']
nav=pd.Series(index=[i['date'] for i in ff],data=[i['nav'] for i in ff],name='funds')
nav=nav[nav.index>'2020-01-01']
nav=nav.astype(float)
nav.plot(figsize=(20,10))
```
In the above code, the url corresponds to the data we just found. We have processed the data into a DataFrame. Then we can easily export the data, or make charts and further analysis.

## 3 Summary

We have successfully obtained the historical net value of the fund portfolio through Python crawlers. With the raw data, we can do more scientific analysis for our investment portfolio.
