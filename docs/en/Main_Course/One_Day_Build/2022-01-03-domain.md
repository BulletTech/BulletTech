## 1 Introduction

Today, it is cost-effective and easy to start your own services or build personal blogs by purchasing a cloud server like xx cloud.

After having our own cloud server, we can access our website by its public IP address (e.g. 139.196.74.248). However, this string of numbers is not easy to remember. So, how do we give our website a catchy name? This article will introduce the whole process of domain registration and filing.

## 2 Purchase of Cloud Server and Domain Name

The purchase of a cloud server doesn't need much explanation. You can choose a configuration that meets your needs on Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud and other various cloud services and purchase it at the right time (promotion). After having your own cloud server, you can follow the documentation of xx cloud to make some simple configurations and start your own services. Via the public IP, we should be able to see our services running successfully.

Then we need to register a domain name. We can register a domain name through different websites. Here we take [Wanwang](https://wanwang.aliyun.com/domain/ 'Wanwang'), a subsidiary of Alibaba Cloud, as an example:

We search the keyword `bullettech`. Some domain names with certain suffixes have already been registered by others. We can choose a suitable domain name with a proper suffix and place an order to purchase.

You can see some important reminders here. Meanwhile, there are some additional services for us to choose from, such as filing manager service (with assistance by professionals in the filing process), cloud DNS (better resolving the domain name to a digital IP) and so on. In fact, DIY is not complicated and the built-in DNS parsing is already suitable. We didn't purchase any additional services for our own website. Readers can select them according to their needs.

## 3 Domain Filing

After registering the domain name, we need real-name authentication. We can find the entrance to real-name authentication in our xx cloud and start it. Real-name authentication takes some time and will eventually be approved.

Then, we can start filing at the ICP of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Similarly, we can find the entrance to ICP filing in xx cloud and start filing. You need to fill in some information, such as the purpose of the website, and fill it in truthfully. Because our website belongs to personal and technological fields, the filing process is relatively simple. Finance-related and certain other websites may require additional processes.

It is worth mentioning that the website name also has certain requirements. If it does not meet the requirements (such as containing national or regional words, commercial terms, forums, etc.), the filing may not be approved. The xx cloud will conduct preliminary review of the filing. If there is a problem with the website name, the customer service will communicate with you by phone. The website name itself has little role.

After successfully submitting, we just need to wait for the review by the regulatory authority. Usually, the review time is not long. Below is the entire process of ICP filing:

After the filing is approved, we also need to place the ICP filing number on the webpage and link it to `https://beian.miit.gov.cn`, which can be simply realized by HTML.

## 4 Public Security Network Filing

After filing the ICP with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, we need to apply for the public security network filing within 30 days after the website is opened by logging in to the `National Internet Security Management Service Platform`.

## 5 Conclusion

It can be seen that the process of domain registration and filing is not complicated. Through the documentation of xx cloud and online information, our website completed the whole process in a short time and can be accessed by the domain name successfully.
