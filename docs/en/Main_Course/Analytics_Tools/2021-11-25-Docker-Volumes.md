## 1 Introduction
In the article [First Experience with Docker](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/gfO5BiK9fqRtWf8rjP8mPA), we introduced the basic concept of Docker. Later, we shared how to [successfully run Docker in Win10](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8B9ye55zpWCCVTA4g4fLQQ) and [use GitHub Action to automatically build and push Docker images](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/BCzu346DvNga84vEUXUbTQ). Friends who have tried it should be able to create images for their program code in Docker, run containers, or use Docker in GitHub Action. Today, we will talk about how to persistently manage data in Dockerâ€”the use of data volumes.

## 2 The Necessity of Data Management
People who first experience Docker may find that whenever we restart the container, the previous data will be lost, or feel that the data is difficult to transfer. This is because Docker's default settings will create all files in a readable container layer in a container. In other words, a container's data is independent and cannot be shared. To achieve data sharing and data migration, we need to use some methods to persistently manage data.

## 3 About Volumes

### 3.1 Advantages

Volumes are a data management mechanism created and maintained by Docker. As shown in the figure below, its biggest feature is that it stores files in the Docker host, which is not accessible by other programs, and has high security when sharing data between different containers; and data backup and migration can be directly performed by Docker commands. In addition, Volumes performs better in Docker Desktop than other methods, which is also the recommended method by Docker official documents.

### 3.2 Common Operations on Volumes

Referencing to the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/'Docker Volumes'), we introduce several use cases of Volumes under different circumstances.

1. We can create and manage Volumes using the following basic commands:
```shell
# Create a Volume and name it my-vol
docker volume create my-vol

# List all Volumes
docker volume ls

# View Volume properties
docker volume inspect my-vol

# Remove a Volume
docker volume rm my-vol

# Remove all Volumes
docker volume prune
```

2. Volumes can be specified when starting a container:
```shell
## Run devtest container
## And attach the container myvol2 to the /app directory
docker run -d \
  --name devtest \
  -v myvol2:/app \
  nginx:latest
```

3. When building multi-container services, developers often choose `docker compose` as a multi-container management tool and write the `docker-compose.yml` file. On the one hand, this file can help us merge all container configuration parameters in a file for unified management. On the other hand, it can help the fast startup or termination of the multi-container service. Here we do not elaborate on each parameter of the `yml` file, but focus on how to define Volumes in this file.

```shell
version: "3.9"
services:
  frontend:
    image: node:lts
    volumes:
      - myapp:/home/node/app
volumes:
  myapp:
    external: true
```
The two volumes settings here, the first one sets the volumes of services, named `myapp`, and the path is stored in `/home/node/app`. The second top-level Volumes setting is to enable the sharing of multiple containers, such as setting `myapp` to be shared by all containers.

4. Use container data that already exists to create Volumes for a new container. The new container is named `nginxtest`, the new Volume is named `nginx-vol`, and the data source path is `/usr/share/nginx/html`.

```shell
 docker run -d \
  --name=nginxtest \
  -v nginx-vol:/usr/share/nginx/html \
  nginx:latest
```

On this basis, you can also add `ro` to set read-only permission, which can prevent others from accidentally deleting or other mistakes when sharing container data.

```shell
 docker run -d \
  --name=nginxtest \
  -v nginx-vol:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro \
  nginx:latest
```

5. Volumes can also be used in scenarios such as data backup and migration.

First, we create a container named `dbstore` with the Volumes `dbdata`:
```shell
docker run -v /dbdata --name dbstore ubuntu /bin/bash
```

Secondly, backup the Volumes of this container. Use `--volumes-from` to specify the source of the container and specify `dbdata` to be backed up to the `backup.tar` file under the path `/backup`.

```shell
docker run --rm --volumes-from dbstore -v $(pwd):/backup ubuntu tar cvf /backup/backup.tar /dbdata
```

Next, migrate the container data that has been backed up. Create a new container `dbstore2`:

```shell
docker run -v /dbdata --name dbstore2 ubuntu /bin/bash
```

Finally, transfer the data from the `backup.tar` file to the new container:

```shell
 docker run --rm --volumes-from dbstore2 -v $(pwd):/backup ubuntu bash -c "cd /dbdata && tar xvf /backup/backup.tar --strip 1"
```

## 4 Conclusion

When deploying services, developing functions is one aspect, and persistent management of data is also an essential part. This article hopes to help you choose the appropriate commands to manage the container's data when using Docker Volume.
