## 1 github


In the impression of many people, GitHub is mainly a tool for programmers to write code.In fact, the main feature of Github is version management and collaborative work, which means that not only programmers, non -technical people can also use it to complete many tasks more efficiently.Therefore, this article will teach you to use github zero foundation to help everyone know this powerful efficiency tool.First of all, please familiarize with common terms during the use of github:


-Cository: It can be regarded as a folder of the deposit code and file. When you are a warehouse manager, you can set access permissions
-Hearote Repository: It can be regarded as a copy of the warehouse, which is usually completed here.
-Master (master or main): the status of the current project is located
-Branch: It can be regarded as a copy of the trunk, which can be temporarily stored and modified. It is often used to update for the main trunk
-Phush update: Submit the modification to the warehouse
-Cap the update: synchronize the update on the warehouse to the current working status
-PULL Requst: Used to merge the modification on the branch to the trunk on the trunk
-Merged: The change on the branch is merged to the trunk, and the warehouse status is updated

Next, you will mainly use GitHub's desktop client (you can download it for free from the official website of Github). With this APP, you can use most of the core functions of Github.


## 2 GitHub what can you do


GitHub is one of the excellent tools in terms of version management and collaborative work.


### 2.1 version management


Specifically, the function of the version management can help save the history of the document to modify the history so that it can be easily checked and rolled when it needs to be traced back.

In the example, Bullettech's warehouse is preserved in the past changes. Click to change to see the change file and corresponding update.


### 2.2 Collaboration


These changes were jointly completed by the team members of Bullettech. When multiplayer collaboration, it is recommended to work on different branches. After the update is completed, you can combine your branch update by merging request (⌘/Ctrl + R).Go to the trunk.At this time, the software will automatically guide you to jump to the web page to create a request, and the team members can review and change. If the requirements meet the requirements, the update can be merged to the trunk.

It is recommended to set up a template for merging requests to fill in the updated information clearly to save a lot of communication. There will also be traces when you look back in the future.Can be in our
[Warehouse] (https://github.com/bullettech/bullettech/tree/main/.github)
Find the corresponding template, and modify the template according to your own needs, and use it in your own project.


### 2.3 Create Blog


GitHub provides a simple blogger with a free server, and Bullettech's own blog is built on Github.You only need to open the GitHub Pages function in the setting option of the warehouse, and the blog is automatically generated. Github provides a lot of templates to choose from. At the same time, you can write it by yourself.

### 3.2 Github desktop basic features


The basic operation is shown in the figure below.Please note that sometimes conflicts occur when synchronized (PULL) warehouses. Most of the reasons are that local updates have not been synchronized to the branch, and others have been updated. At this time, you need to put your update (Stash) or you need to put it on the same before synchronization.Discard, these two operations can be found in the top Branch menu.

In summary, after mastering these basic knowledge and skills, you can smoothly use github to manage, collaborate and create your own blogs. So far, do not write a line of code.Of course, the use of code can also be easily operated by github. Next time we will use the command to operate github, so stay tuned!
